# Creating a New Integration

There are two main types of CloudQuery integrations:
 - **source** integrations read data from a cloud provider, and
 - **destination** integrations define a destination to write source data into. This is usually a database or file system.

## Writing a Source Integration

See the following links for more information on writing source integrations (we will add more resources here over time):

## Writing a Destination Integration

This section is a work in progress. For now, raise an issue or reach out to us on our [Community](https://community.cloudquery.io) if 
you would like to request (or work on) a new destination integration.
