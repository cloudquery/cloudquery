# Creating a New Plugin

There are two main types of CloudQuery plugins:
 - **source** plugins read data from a cloud provider, and
 - **destination** plugins define a destination to write source data into. This is usually a database or file system.

## Writing a Source Plugin

See the following links for more information on writing source plugins (we will add more resources here over time):

## Writing a Destination Plugin

This section is a work in progress. For now, raise an issue or reach out to us on Discord if 
you would like to request (or work on) a new destination plugin.
