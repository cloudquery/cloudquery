# Creating a New Plugin

There are two main types of CloudQuery plugins:
 - **source** plugins read data from a cloud provider, and
 - **destination** plugins define a destination to write source data into. This is usually a database or file system.

## Writing a Source Plugin

Source plugins were previously called **Providers**. See the following pages for more information on how to write these:

- [Developing a New Provider](https://docs.cloudquery.io/docs/developers/developing-new-provider)
- [Tutorial: Creating a New Provider
](https://docs.cloudquery.io/docs/developers/tutorials/creating-new-provider)

## Writing a Target Plugin

This section is a work in progress. For now, raise an issue or reach out to us on Discord if 
you would like to request (or work on) a new destination plugin.
