## GCP Provider

The CloudQuery GCP provider pulls configuration out of GCP resources, normalizes them and stores them in PostgreSQL database.

### Install

```shell
cloudquery init gcp
```

### Authentication

CloudQuery needs to be authenticated with your GCP account in order to `fetch` information about your cloud setup.
You need to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable - see [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#command-line) for more details on where to get it.

On Linux/MacOS (Similar for windows):

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

### Configuration

The following configuration section can be automaticlly generated by `cloudquery init gcp`:

```hcl
provider "gcp" {
  configuration {
    // Optional. List of folders to get projects from. Required permission: resourcemanager.projects.list
    // folder_ids = [ "organizations/<ORG_ID>", "folders/<FOLDER_ID>" ]
    // Optional. Maximum level of folders to recurse into
    // folders_max_depth = 5
    // Optional. If not specified either using all projects accessible.
    // project_ids = [<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_PROJECT_ID>]
    // Optional. ServiceAccountKeyJSON passed as value instead of a file path, can be passed also via env: CQ_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON
    // service_account_key_json = <YOUR_JSON_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_DATA>
    // Optional. GRPC Retry/backoff configuration, time units in seconds. Documented in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connection-backoff.md
    // backoff_base_delay = 1
    // backoff_multiplier = 1.6
    // backoff_max_delay = 120
    // backoff_jitter = 0.2
    // backoff_min_connect_timeout = 0
  }

  resources = ["*"]
}
```

By default cloudquery will fetch all configurations from **all** resources in **all** regions in the **default** project. You can customize this behaviour with the following arguments:

- `project_ids` - Specify multiple projects that you want to fetch configurations from.

### Query Examples:

#### Find all buckets without uniform bucket-level access

```sql
SELECT project_id, name, self_link AS link
FROM gcp_storage_buckets
WHERE iam_configuration_uniform_bucket_level_access_enabled = FALSE;
```
