## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to CloudQuery? There are few key labels that you can take a look in the issue

* `bug` - Can be a small issue of missing column, incorrect primary key which are good for begineers. Or more involved one.
* `documentation` - Those are great for begineers as it gives the opportunity to both learn and put it in writing for everyone else.
* `resource` - This is usually support for a new resource that was requested.
