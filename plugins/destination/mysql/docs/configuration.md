The MySQL destination utilizes batching, and supports [`batch_size`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size) and [`batch_size_bytes`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size_bytes).

## MySQL spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the MySQL destination plugin.

- `connection_string` (`string`) (required)

  Connection string to connect to the database. See the [Go driver documentation](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name) for details.

  - `"user:password@localhost:3306/dbname?timeout=30s\u0026readTimeout=1s\u0026writeTimeout=1s"` connect and set various timeouts
  - `"user:password@/dbname?loc=UTC\u0026allowNativePasswords=true\u0026tls=preferred"` connect and set location and native password allowance, and prefer TLS
