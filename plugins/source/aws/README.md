# AWS Source Plugin

The AWS Source plugin extracts information from many of the supported services by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Authentication

The AWS source plugin needs to be authenticated with your account/s in order to sync information from your cloud setup.

The plugin requires only _read_ permissions (we will never make any changes to your cloud setup), so, following the principle of least privilege, it's recommended to grant it read-only permissions.

There are multiple ways to authenticate with AWS, and the plugin respects the AWS credential provider chain. This means that CloudQuery will follow the following priorities when attempting to authenticate:

- The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables.
- The `credentials` and `config` files in `~/.aws` (the `credentials` file takes priority).
  - You can also use `aws sso` to authenticate cloudquery - [you can read more about it here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html).
- IAM roles for AWS compute resources (including EC2 instances, Fargate and ECS containers).

You can read more about AWS authentication [here](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/creds-config-files.html).

### Environment Variables

CloudQuery can use the credentials from the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and
`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables (`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` can be optional for some accounts). For information on obtaining credentials, see the
[AWS guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/getting-started/#get-your-aws-access-keys).

To export the environment variables (On Linux/Mac - similar for Windows):

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={Your AWS Access Key ID}
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={Your AWS secret access key}
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN={Your AWS session token}
```

### Shared Configuration files

The plugin can use credentials from your `credentials` and `config` files in the `.aws` directory in your home folder.
The contents of these files are practically interchangeable, but CloudQuery will prioritize credentials in the `credentials` file.

For information about obtaining credentials, see the
[AWS guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/getting-started/#get-your-aws-access-keys).

Here are example contents for a `credentials` file:

```toml title="~/.aws/credentials"
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

You can also specify credentials for a different profile, and instruct CloudQuery to use the credentials from this profile instead of the default one.

For example:

```toml title="~/.aws/credentials"
[myprofile]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Then, you can either export the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable (On Linux/Mac, similar for Windows):

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
```

or, configure your desired profile in the `local_profile` field:

```yaml title="aws.yml"
accounts:
  id: <account_alias>
  local_profile: myprofile
```

### IAM Roles for AWS Compute Resources

The plugin can use IAM roles for AWS compute resources (including EC2 instances, Fargate and ECS containers).
If you configured your AWS compute resources with IAM, the plugin will use these roles automatically.
For more information on configuring IAM, see the AWS docs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html).

## Query Examples

### Find all public-facing load balancers

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_elbv2_load_balancers WHERE scheme = 'internet-facing';
```

### Find all unencrypted RDS instances

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_rds_clusters WHERE storage_encrypted IS FALSE;
```

### Find all S3 buckets that are permitted to be public

```sql
SELECT arn, region
FROM aws_s3_buckets
WHERE block_public_acls IS NOT TRUE
    OR block_public_policy IS NOT TRUE
    OR ignore_public_acls IS NOT TRUE
    OR restrict_public_buckets IS NOT TRUE
```
