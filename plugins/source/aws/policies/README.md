# CloudQuery Policies
CloudQuery SQL Policies for AWS

## Deprecated:

CloudQuery SQL Policies for AWS has been deprecated and all queries have been moved to the `/policies_v1` directory, but policies still are available in the `/policies` directory in the git history. Going forward all CloudQuery Policies will continue to be available in the [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/addons/transformation). The Policies listed via the Hub have many benefits including:
- Built on top of dbt for ease of extensibility and integration with other tools
- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake)
