## Installing

### Option 1: Downloading via Git

This method is good for local testing if you have git installed. Clone this repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery.git cloudquery
```

Check out the tag matching the AWS Source plugin version you are using:

```bash
cd cloudquery
git checkout plugins-source-aws-v16.3.0  # Example. Change to match the AWS version in your CloudQuery source config
```

Change directory into `plugins/source/aws/policies`:

```bash
cd plugins/source/aws/policies
```

### Option 2: Downloading via Releases

This is an alternative method to get the correct policies for a given AWS source plugin version, and is a better fit for automation.

The policies for every plugin version are also included in the release zip file. The following command will download the policies for AWS and unzip them into a directory called `policies`. Change `v16.3.0` to your currently configured version before running the command:

```bash
curl -iL https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases/download/plugins-source-aws-v16.3.0/aws_linux_amd64.zip -o aws.zip && unzip aws.zip "policies/*"
```

## Running

You can execute policies with `psql`. For example:

```bash
# Set DSN to your PostgreSQL populated by CloudQuery
export DSN=postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres
# Execute CIS V1.2.0 Policy
psql ${DSN} -f  ./cis_v1.2.0/policy.sql
```

This will create all the results in `aws_policy_results` table which you can query directly, connect to any BI system (Grafana, Preset, AWS QuickSight, PowerBI, â€¦).

You can also output it into CSV or HTML with the following built-in `psql` commands:

```bash
# Set DSN to your PostgreSQL populated by CloudQuery
export DSN=postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres
# default tabular output
psql ${DSN} -c "select * from aws_policy_results"
# CSV output
psql ${DSN} -c "select * from aws_policy_results" --csv
# HTML output
psql ${DSN} -c "select * from aws_policy_results" --html
```

## Dashboards

Currently we have a pre-built compliance dashboard on top of the `aws_policy_results` table which is available [here](../dashboards/grafana/compliance.json)
