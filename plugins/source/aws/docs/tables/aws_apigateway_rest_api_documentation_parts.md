## Columns
| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----  |
|rest_api_cq_id|uuid|Unique CloudQuery ID of aws_apigateway_rest_apis table (FK)|
|rest_api_id|text|The API's identifier. This identifier is unique across all of your APIs in API Gateway.|
|arn|text|The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.|
|id|text|The DocumentationPart identifier, generated by API Gateway when the DocumentationPart is created.|
|location_type|text|[Required] The type of API entity to which the documentation content applies. Valid values are API, AUTHORIZER, MODEL, RESOURCE, METHOD, PATH_PARAMETER, QUERY_PARAMETER, REQUEST_HEADER, REQUEST_BODY, RESPONSE, RESPONSE_HEADER, and RESPONSE_BODY. Content inheritance does not apply to any entity of the API, AUTHORIZER, METHOD, MODEL, REQUEST_BODY, or RESOURCE type.|
|location_method|text|The HTTP verb of a method. It is a valid field for the API entity types of METHOD, PATH_PARAMETER, QUERY_PARAMETER, REQUEST_HEADER, REQUEST_BODY, RESPONSE, RESPONSE_HEADER, and RESPONSE_BODY. The default value is * for any method. When an applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the same type with more general specifications of the other location attributes, the child entity's method attribute must match that of the parent entity exactly.|
|location_name|text|The name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and required field for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER, MODEL, PATH_PARAMETER, QUERY_PARAMETER, REQUEST_HEADER, REQUEST_BODY and RESPONSE_HEADER. It is an invalid field for any other entity type.|
|location_path|text|The URL path of the target. It is a valid field for the API entity types of RESOURCE, METHOD, PATH_PARAMETER, QUERY_PARAMETER, REQUEST_HEADER, REQUEST_BODY, RESPONSE, RESPONSE_HEADER, and RESPONSE_BODY. The default value is / for the root resource. When an applicable child entity inherits the content of another entity of the same type with more general specifications of the other location attributes, the child entity's path attribute must match that of the parent entity as a prefix.|
|location_status_code|text|The HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for the API entity types of RESPONSE, RESPONSE_HEADER, and RESPONSE_BODY. The default value is * for any status code. When an applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the same type with more general specifications of the other location attributes, the child entity's statusCode attribute must match that of the parent entity exactly.|
|properties|text|A content map of API-specific key-value pairs describing the targeted API entity. The map must be encoded as a JSON string, e.g., "{ \"description\": \"The API does ...\" }". Only OpenAPI-compliant documentation-related fields from the properties map are exported and, hence, published as part of the API entity definitions, while the original documentation parts are exported in a OpenAPI extension of x-amazon-apigateway-documentation.|
