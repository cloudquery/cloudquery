# Table: aws_apprunner_vpc_ingress_connections

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_VpcIngressConnection.html

Notes:
- 'account_id' has been renamed to 'source_account_id' to avoid conflict with the 'account_id' column that indicates what account this was synced from.

The primary key for this table is **arn**.
