## Terraform Provider

The CloudQuery Terraform provider pulls terraform state, normalizes it and stores it in PostgreSQL database.

### Install

```shell
cloudquery init terraform
```

### Configuration

The following configuration section can be automatically generated by `cloudquery init terraform`:

```yaml
providers:
    # provider configurations
    - name: terraform
      configuration:
        config:
         - name: mylocal # local backend
           backend: local
           path: ./examples/terraform.tfstate
         - name: myremote # s3 backend
           backend: s3
           bucket: tf-states
           key: terraform.tfstate
           region: us-east-1
           role_arn: ""
      # list of resources to fetch
      resources:
        - tf.data
```

You can have multiple backends at the same time, simply by describing them in the configuration. Every config block describes one backend to handle.

Cloudquery currently supports LOCAL and S3 backends.
#### S3 backend example:
```yaml
    config:
      - name: myremote # s3 backend
        backend: s3
        bucket: "<terraform state bucket>"
        key: "<terraform state key>"
        region: us-east-1
        role_arn: ""
```

### Authentication (S3 Backend)

To authenticate cloudquery with your Terraform state in S3 you can use any of the following options (see full documentation at [AWS SDK V2](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials)):

- Static Credentials: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- Shared configuration files (via `aws configure`).
    - SDK defaults to `credentials` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer.
    - SDK defaults to `config` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer.
- If your application uses an ECS task definition or RunTask API operation, IAM role for tasks.
- If your application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, IAM role for Amazon EC2.
