# Terraform Plugin

The CloudQuery Terraform plugin extracts terraform state.

## Install

```bash
cloudquery generate source terraform
```

## Configuration

The following configuration section can be automatically generated by `cloudquery generate source terraform`:

```yaml
backends:
 - name: mylocal # local backend
   type: local
   config:
     path: ./examples/terraform.tfstate
# - name: myremote # s3 backend
#   type: s3
#   config:
#     bucket: tf-states
#     key: terraform.tfstate
#     region: us-east-1
#     role_arn: ""
```

You can have multiple backends at the same time, by describing them in the configuration. Every configuration block describes one backend to handle.

CloudQuery currently supports LOCAL and S3 backends.

## S3 backend example

```yaml
backends:
  - name: myremote # s3 backend
    type: s3
    config:
      bucket: "<terraform state bucket>"
      key: "<terraform state key>"
      region: us-east-1
      role_arn: ""
```

### Authentication (S3 Backend)

To authenticate CloudQuery with your Terraform state in S3 you can use any of the following options (see full documentation at [AWS SDK V2](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials)):

- Static Credentials: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- Shared configuration files (via `aws configure`).
  - SDK defaults to `credentials` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer
  - SDK defaults to `config` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer
- If your application uses an ECS task definition or RunTask API operation, IAM role for tasks
- If your application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, IAM role for Amazon EC2
