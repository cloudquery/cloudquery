```yaml copy
kind: source
# Common source-plugin configuration
spec:
  name: bitbucket
  path: cloudquery/bitbucket
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_BITBUCKET"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["DESTINATION_NAME"]
  # bitbucket-specific configuration
  spec:
    username: "${BITBUCKET_USERNAME}" # required
    password: "${BITBUCKET_PASSWORD}" # required
```

:::callout{type="info"}
This example uses environment variable expansion to read the `username` and `password` options from `BITBUCKET_USERNAME` and `BITBUCKET_PASSWORD` environment variables respectively. You can also hardcode the value in the configuration file, but this is not advised for production settings.
