The CloudQuery Bitbucket plugin pulls data from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/destination)).

The plugin discover all workspaces and repositories in your account and syncs them to the destination.

## Example Configuration

This example syncs from Bitbucket to a Postgres destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).
