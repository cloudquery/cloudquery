The Azure plugin uses [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/36d9f8d6bd5e79da7d2f77657d475b44612850f2/sdk/azidentity#defaultazurecredential) to authenticate.

`DefaultAzureCredential` will attempt to authenticate via different mechanisms in order, stopping when one succeeds. The order is described in detail in the [Azure SDK documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/36d9f8d6bd5e79da7d2f77657d475b44612850f2/sdk/azidentity#defaultazurecredential).

For getting started quickly with the Azure plugin, we recommend using a service principal and exporting environment variables or using `az login`. The latter is highly discouraged for production use as it requires spawning a new Azure CLI process each time an authentication token is needed and causes memory and performance issues.
