## Azure Provider

The CloudQuery Azure provider pulls configuration out of Azure resources, normalizes them and stores them in PostgreSQL database.

### Install

 ```shell
 cloudquery init azure
 ```

### Authentication

CloudQuery needs to be authenticated with your Azure account in order to fetch information about your cloud setup.

You can either authenticate with `az login` (when running CloudQuery locally), or by using a "service principal" and exporting environment variables (appropriate for automated deployments).

You can find out more about authentication with Azure at Azure's [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go) for the golang sdk.

#### Authentication with `az login`

First, install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (`az`). Then, login with the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

You are now authenticated with CloudQuery!

#### Authentication with Environment Variables

You will need to create a service principal for CloudQuery to use:

**Creating a service principal**

First, install the Azure CLI (`az`).

Then, login with the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

Then, create the service principal cloudquery will use to access your cloud deployment. WARNING: The output of
 `az ad sp create-for-rbac` contains credentials that you must protect - Make sure to handle with appropriate care.
 This example uses bash - The commands for CMD and PowerShell are similar.

```bash
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Security'

# Create a service-principal for cloudquery
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name cloudquery-sp --scopes /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID --role Reader
```

(you can, of course, choose any name you'd like for your service-principal, `cloudquery-sp` is just an example. 
If the service principal doesn't exist it will create a new one, otherwise it will update an existing one)

The output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac` should look like this:

```
{
  "appId": <YOUR AZURE_CLIENT_ID>,
  "displayName": "cloudquery-sp",
  "password": <YOUR AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET>,
  "tenant": <YOUR AZURE_TENANT_ID>
}
```

**Exporting environment variables**

Next, you need to export the environment variables that cloudquery will use to `fetch` your cloud configuration. 
Copy them from the output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac` (or, take the opportunity to show off your jq-foo). 
The example shows how to export environment variables for linux - exporting for CMD and PowerShell is similar.

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` is `tenant` in the json.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is `appId` in the json.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` is `password` in the json.

```bash
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<YOUR AZURE_TENANT_ID>
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR AZURE_CLIENT_ID>
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET>
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

### Configuration

The following configuration section can be automatically generated by `cloudquery init azure`:

```yml title="cloudquery.yml"
providers:
  - name: azure
    # configuration:
      # subscriptions:
        # Optional: If you only want to fetch data from a single or multiple subscriptions, you can specify it here.
        # - "<subscription_1>"
        # - "<subscription_2>"
    resources:
      - "*"
```

By default, CloudQuery will fetch all configuration from **all** resources in **all** subscription. You can change this behaviour with the following arguments:

- `subscriptions` **(Optional)** - Specify multiple subscriptions to fetch data from them concurrently.

### Query Examples

#### Find all MySQL servers

 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM azure_mysql_servers;
 ```

#### Find storage accounts that are allowing non-HTTPS traffic

 ```sql
 SELECT * from azure_storage_accounts where enable_https_traffic_only = false;
 ```

#### Find all expired key vaults

 ```sql
 SELECT * from azure_keyvault_vault_keys where attributes_expires >= extract(epoch from now()) * 1000;
 ```
