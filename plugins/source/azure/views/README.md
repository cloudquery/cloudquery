# Azure Views

This directory contains useful aggregated views that you can create against the CloudQuery schema manually and then run queries and visualizations.

Those views are also tests in CI to make sure it works with the latest schema.

For dashboard examples that reuse those views take a look at [dashboards](../dashboards).
