The GCP plugin authenticates using your [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default). Available options are all the same options described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) in detail:

Local Environment:

- `gcloud auth application-default login` (recommended when running locally)

Google Cloud cloud-based development environment:

- When you run on Cloud Shell or Cloud Code credentials are already available.

Google Cloud containerized environment:

- When running on GKE use [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity).

[Google Cloud services that support attaching a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#attached-sa):

- Services such as Compute Engine, App Engine and functions supporting attaching a user-managed service account which will CloudQuery will be able to utilize.

On-premises or another cloud provider

- The suggested way is to use [Workload identity federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation)
- If not available you can always use service account keys and export the location of the key via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. **Highly not recommended as long-lived keys are a security risk**
