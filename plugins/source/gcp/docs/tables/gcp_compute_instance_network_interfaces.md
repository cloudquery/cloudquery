## Columns
| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----  |
|instance_cq_id|uuid|Unique ID of gcp_compute_instances table (FK)|
|instance_id|text||
|fingerprint|text|Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network interface This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or adding a NetworkInterface An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the NetworkInterface The request will fail with error 400 Bad Request if the fingerprint is not provided, or 412 Precondition Failed if the fingerprint is out of date|
|ipv6_address|text|An IPv6 internal network address for this network interface|
|kind|text|Type of the resource Always compute#networkInterface for network interfaces|
|name|text|The name of the network interface, which is generated by the server For network devices, these are eth0, eth1, etc|
|network|text|URL of the network resource for this instance When creating an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the default network global/networks/default is used; if the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred  If you specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL For example, the following are all valid URLs: - https://wwwgoogleapis|
|network_ip|text|An IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance for this network interface If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP is assigned by the system|
|nic_type|text|The type of vNIC to be used on this interface This may be gVNIC or VirtioNet|
|subnetwork|text|The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance If the network resource is in legacy mode, do not specify this field If the network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is required If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a full or partial URL For example, the following are all valid URLs: - https://wwwgoogleapis|
