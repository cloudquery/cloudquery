# Table: gcp_compute_url_map_path_matchers
A matcher for the path portion of the URL The BackendService from the longest-matched rule will serve the URL If no rule was matched, the default service will be used
## Columns
| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----  |
|url_map_cq_id|uuid|Unique CloudQuery ID of gcp_compute_url_maps table (FK)|
|default_route_action|jsonb|defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the pathRules or routeRules match The load balancer performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set UrlMaps for external HTTP(S) load balancers support only the urlRewrite action within a pathMatcher's defaultRouteAction|
|default_service|text|The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource This will be used if none of the pathRules or routeRules defined by this PathMatcher are matched For example, the following are all valid URLs to a BackendService resource: - https://wwwgoogleapiscom/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService  - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService  - global/backendServices/backendService  If defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc take effect prior to sending the request to the backend However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect  or defaultRouteActionweightedBackendService must be set Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource default_service: - computebackendBucketsuse - computebackendServices|
|default_url_redirect_host_redirect|text|The host that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was supplied in the request The value must be between 1 and 255 characters|
|default_url_redirect_https_redirect|boolean|If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https If set to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that of the request This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys Setting this true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted The default is set to false|
|default_url_redirect_path_redirect|text|The path that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was supplied in the request pathRedirect cannot be supplied together with prefixRedirect Supply one alone or neither If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for the redirect The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters|
|default_url_redirect_prefix_redirect|text|The prefix that replaces the prefixMatch specified in the HttpRouteRuleMatch, retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request prefixRedirect cannot be supplied together with pathRedirect Supply one alone or neither If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for the redirect The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters|
|default_url_redirect_redirect_response_code|text|The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction Supported values are: - MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301 - FOUND, which corresponds to 302 - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303 - TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307 In this case, the request method will be retained - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308 In this case, the request method will be retained|
|default_url_redirect_strip_query|boolean|If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed prior to redirecting the request If set to false, the query portion of the original URL is retained The default is set to false|
|description|text|An optional description of this resource Provide this property when you create the resource|
|header_action|jsonb|Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for the selected backendService HeaderAction specified here are applied after the matching HttpRouteRule HeaderAction and before the HeaderAction in the UrlMap  Note that headerAction is not supported for Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL Not supported when the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true|
|name|text|The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule|
|path_rules|jsonb|The list of path rules Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based on simple path matching is all that's required The order by which path rules are specified does not matter Matches are always done on the longest-path-first basis For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/* irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set|
|route_rules|jsonb|The list of HTTP route rules Use this list instead of pathRules when advanced route matching and routing actions are desired routeRules are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number Within a given pathMatcher, you can set only one of pathRules or routeRules|
