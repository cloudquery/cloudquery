# Table: gcp_monitoring_alert_policy_conditions
A condition is a true/false test that determines when an alerting policy should open an incident If a condition evaluates to true, it signifies that something is wrong
## Columns
| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----  |
|alert_policy_cq_id|uuid|Unique ID of gcp_monitoring_alert_policies table (FK)|
|absent_duration|text|The amount of time that a time series must fail to report new data to be considered failing The minimum value of this field is 120 seconds Larger values that are a multiple of a minute--for example, 240 or 300 seconds--are supported If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned The Durationnanos field is ignored|
|absent_filter|text|A filter (https://cloudgooglecom/monitoring/api/v3/filters) that identifies which time series should be compared with the thresholdThe filter is similar to the one that is specified in the ListTimeSeries request (https://cloudgooglecom/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projectstimeSeries/list) (that call is useful to verify the time series that will be retrieved / processed) The filter must specify the metric type and the resource type Optionally, it can specify resource labels and metric labels This field must not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length|
|absent_trigger_count|bigint|The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered|
|absent_trigger_percent|float|The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered|
|monitoring_query_language_duration|text|The amount of time that a time series must violate the threshold to be considered failing Currently, only values that are a multiple of a minute--eg, 0, 60, 120, or 300 seconds--are supported If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly|
|monitoring_query_language_query|text|Monitoring Query Language (https://cloudgooglecom/monitoring/mql) query that outputs a boolean stream|
|monitoring_query_language_trigger_count|bigint|The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered|
|monitoring_query_language_trigger_percent|float|The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered|
|threshold_comparison|text|The comparison to apply between the time series (indicated by filter and aggregation) and the threshold (indicated by threshold_value) The comparison is applied on each time series, with the time series on the left-hand side and the threshold on the right-hand sideOnly COMPARISON_LT and COMPARISON_GT are supported currently  Possible values:   "COMPARISON_UNSPECIFIED" - No ordering relationship is specified   "COMPARISON_GT" - True if the left argument is greater than the right argument   "COMPARISON_GE" - True if the left argument is greater than or equal to the right argument   "COMPARISON_LT" - True if the left argument is less than the right argument   "COMPARISON_LE" - True if the left argument is less than or equal to the right argument   "COMPARISON_EQ" - True if the left argument is equal to the right argument   "COMPARISON_NE" - True if the left argument is not equal to the right argument|
|threshold_denominator_filter|text|A filter (https://cloudgooglecom/monitoring/api/v3/filters) that identifies a time series that should be used as the denominator of a ratio that will be compared with the threshold If a denominator_filter is specified, the time series specified by the filter field will be used as the numeratorThe filter must specify the metric type and optionally may contain restrictions on resource type, resource labels, and metric labels This field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length|
|threshold_duration|text|The amount of time that a time series must violate the threshold to be considered failing Currently, only values that are a multiple of a minute--eg, 0, 60, 120, or 300 seconds--are supported If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly|
|threshold_filter|text|A filter (https://cloudgooglecom/monitoring/api/v3/filters) that identifies which time series should be compared with the thresholdThe filter is similar to the one that is specified in the ListTimeSeries request (https://cloudgooglecom/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projectstimeSeries/list) (that call is useful to verify the time series that will be retrieved / processed) The filter must specify the metric type and the resource type Optionally, it can specify resource labels and metric labels This field must not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length|
|threshold_value|float|A value against which to compare the time series|
|threshold_trigger_count|bigint|The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered|
|threshold_trigger_percent|float|The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered|
|display_name|text|A short name or phrase used to identify the condition in dashboards, notifications, and incidents To avoid confusion, don't use the same display name for multiple conditions in the same policy|
|name|text|if the condition exists The unique resource name for this condition Its format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID]/conditions/[ CONDITION_ID] [CONDITION_ID] is assigned by Stackdriver Monitoring when the condition is created as part of a new or updated alerting policyWhen calling the alertPoliciescreate method, do not include the name field in the conditions of the requested alerting policy Stackdriver Monitoring creates the condition identifiers and includes them in the new policyWhen calling the alertPoliciesupdate method to update a policy, including a condition name causes the existing condition to be updated Conditions without names are added to the updated policy Existing conditions are deleted if they are not updatedBest practice is to preserve [CONDITION_ID] if you make only small changes, such as those to condition thresholds, durations, or trigger values Otherwise, treat the change as a new condition and let the existing condition be deleted|
