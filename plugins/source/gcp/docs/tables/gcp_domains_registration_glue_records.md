# Table: gcp_domains_registration_glue_records
Defines a host on your domain that is a DNS name server for your domain and/or other domains Glue records are a way of making the IP address of a name server known, even when it serves DNS queries for its parent domain For example, when `nsexamplecom` is a name server for `examplecom`, the host `nsexamplecom` must have a glue record to break the circular DNS reference
