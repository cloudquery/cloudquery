# Table: gcp_compute_backend_services
Represents a Backend Service resource  A backend service defines how Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves.

|cdn_policy_max_ttl|bigint|Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive Headers sent to the client will not be modified Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate" The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL|
|cdn_policy_negative_caching|boolean|Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy|
|cdn_policy_negative_caching_policy|jsonb|Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code negative_caching must be enabled to configure negative_caching_policy Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs Note that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a policy exists|

|cdn_policy_serve_while_stale|bigint|Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered when refreshing the cache This setting defines the default "max-stale" duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale directive Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week) Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale|
|cdn_policy_signed_url_cache_max_age_sec|bigint|Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be considered fresh After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served Defaults to 1hr (3600s) When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header The actual headers served in responses will not be altered|
