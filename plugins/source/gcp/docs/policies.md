# Policies and Compliance Frameworks

Policies are a set of standard SQL queries that can be run to check the security and compliance of your cloud resources against best practice frameworks.

This page documents the available CloudQuery SQL Policies for GCP. See the [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/gcp/policies) for installation instructions.

### Dependent Views

GCP CIS v1.2.0 depends on the following views:

  - gcp_firewall_allowed_rules<sup>*</sup>
  - gcp_project_policy_members<sup>*</sup>
  - gcp_public_buckets_accesses<sup>*</sup>

  <sup>*</sup> These views are automatically created or updated by this policy.

### Unused Views
