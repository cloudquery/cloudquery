# Hacker News Source Plugin

The Hacker News Source plugin for CloudQuery extracts configuration from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

It can be used for real applications, but is mainly intended to serve as a reference for how to write an incremental CloudQuery Source plugin.
