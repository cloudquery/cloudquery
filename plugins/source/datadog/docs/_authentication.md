CloudQuery requires only `DD_CLIENT_API_KEY` and `DD_CLIENT_APP_KEY`. Follow [this guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/) for how to create an API key and app key for CloudQuery.

CloudQuery requires only *read* permissions (we will never make any changes to your Datadog account),
so, following the principle of the least privilege, it's recommended to grant it read-only permissions.
