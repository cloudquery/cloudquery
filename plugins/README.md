# CloudQuery Plugins

This directory contains all official CloudQuery plugins that can be used to extract and load data from a source (source plugin) to a destination (destination plugin).

Plugins are not used directly, but are used by the [CloudQuery CLI](../cli). For an overview of the CLI, see [the docs](https://docs.cloudquery.io/docs/cli/fetch/overview).
