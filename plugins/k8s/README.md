# CloudQuery Provider Plugin for Kubernetes

This [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery)
provider transforms Kubernetes resource to relational and graph databases.

## What is CloudQuery

CloudQuery pulls, normalize, expose and monitor your cloud infrastructure and SaaS apps as SQL or Graph(Neo4j) database.
This abstracts various scattered APIs enabling you to define security,governance,cost and compliance policies with SQL
 or [Cypher(Neo4j)](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/).

cloudquery can be easily extended to more resources and SaaS providers (open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/issues)). 

Think about cloudquery as a compliance-as-code tool inspired by tools like [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)
and [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), cool right?
