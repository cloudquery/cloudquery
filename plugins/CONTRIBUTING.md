## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to CloudQuery? There are a few key labels that you can use to search for issues:

* `bug` - Can be a small issue of a missing column or incorrect primary key, which are good for beginners. Or more involved one.
* `documentation` - Those are great for beginners as it gives the opportunity to both learn and put it in writing for everyone else.
* `resource` - This is usually support for a new resource that was requested.

If you don't see any issues that you think you can help with reach out to the community on [Discord](https://cloudquery.io/discord)--we would be happy to work with you!
