```

## **Why CloudQuery?**

- **Composable and flexible** - Use the languages, destinations, and orchestrators you want. CloudQuery is built to fit into your stack, not the other way around.
- **Runs on your infrastructure** - Your cloud data never touches CloudQuery's servers. Full privacy, built for regulated, secure, and performance-critical environments.
- **Built for developers** - Code-first, extensible plugins, multi-language, open plugin system, no lock-in. Write it, extend it, ship it. No black boxes, no unexplained failures.
- **Fast, powerful data movement** - Move large volumes of data with high performance and fine-grained control, powered by Apache Arrow. Perfect for feeding AI models, LLM pipelines, or large-scale data stores.
- **Specialized plugin coverage** - Support for complex, unique data sources such as cloud infrastructure, security, and FinOps data.
