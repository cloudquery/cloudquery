## Example Queries

These SQL queries are sampled from CloudQuery policies and are compatible with PostgreSQL.

### Ensure that retention policies on log buckets are configured using Bucket Lock (Automated)

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT
  gsb.name AS resource_id,
  'Ensure that retention policies on log buckets are configured using Bucket Lock (Automated)'
    AS title,
  gls.project_id AS project_id,
  CASE
  WHEN gls.destination LIKE 'storage.googleapis.com/%'
  AND (
      (gsb.retention_policy->>'IsLocked')::BOOL = false
      OR (gsb.retention_policy->>'RetentionPeriod')::INT8 = 0
    )
  THEN 'fail'
  ELSE 'pass'
  END
    AS status
FROM
  gcp_logging_sinks AS gls
  JOIN gcp_storage_buckets AS gsb ON
      gsb.name = replace(gls.destination, 'storage.googleapis.com/', '');
```

### Ensure that sinks are configured for all log entries (Automated)

```sql
WITH
  found_sinks
    AS (
      SELECT
        project_id, name, count(*) AS configured_sinks
      FROM
        gcp_logging_sinks AS gls
      WHERE
        gls.filter = ''
      GROUP BY
        project_id, name
    )
SELECT
  name AS resource_id,
  'Ensure that sinks are configured for all log entries (Automated)' AS title,
  project_id AS project_id,
  CASE WHEN configured_sinks = 0 THEN 'fail' ELSE 'pass' END AS status
FROM
  found_sinks;
```
