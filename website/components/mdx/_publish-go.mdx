1. (Optional, recommended) In the root directory of your plugin repository run `git tag v1.0.0` to tag the version you're about to publish (replace `v1.0.0` with the version you'd like to publish).
2. (Optional, recommended) Run `git push origin v1.0.0` to push the tag.
3. Run `go run main.go package --docs-dir docs -m 'feat: Initial release' v1.0.0 .` to package the plugin. `v1.0.0` should match the tag you created in step 1. The `-m` specifies the changelog message that will be used in the release notes and it supports markdown. See example [here](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/alicloud/v4.0.14/versions). `docs` should be a directory containing markdown files that serve as documentation for the plugin. Read more about the documentation format [here](#documentation-format).
4. Run `cloudquery plugin publish` to publish a draft version of the plugin. The version will show up under the versions tab of your plugin in [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io). As long as the version is in draft it's mutable and you can re-package the plugin and publish it again.
5. Once you're ready run `cloudquery plugin publish -f` to publish a non draft version of the plugin. This version will be immutable and will show up in [Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/). Allow up to 1 hour for the Hub to reflect the changes.
