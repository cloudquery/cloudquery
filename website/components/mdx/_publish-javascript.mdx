1. Your plugin code needs to specify the plugin name, version, team name, and plugin type in the function that creates a new plugin. See the example from our [plugin template](https://github.com/cloudquery/javascript-plugin-template) below:

```javascript
pluginClient.plugin = newPlugin("cq-js-sample", version, newClient, {
  kind: "source",
  team: "cloudquery",
});
```

2. Build your plugin using `npm run build` command. If you used the [plugin template](https://github.com/cloudquery/javascript-plugin-template) to create your plugin, the build files will be in the `dist` directory.
3. (Optional, recommended) In the root directory of your plugin repository run `git tag v1.0.0` to tag the version you're about to publish (replace `v1.0.0` with the version you'd like to publish).
4. (Optional, recommended) Run `git push origin v1.0.0` to push the tag.
5. Run `node dist/main.js package v0.0.1 . -m "test packaging"` to package the plugin. `v1.0.0` should match the tag you created in step 3. The `-m` specifies the changelog message that will be used in the release notes and it supports markdown. See example [here](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/alicloud/v4.0.14/versions). `docs` should be a directory containing markdown files that serve as documentation for the plugin. Read more about the documentation format [here](#documentation-format).
6. Run `cloudquery login` to authenticate your CLI with CloudQuery.
7. Run `cloudquery plugin publish` to publish a draft version of the plugin. The version will show up under the versions tab of your plugin in [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io). As long as the version is in draft it's mutable and you can re-package the plugin and publish it again.
8. Once you're ready run `cloudquery plugin publish -f` to publish a finalized version of the plugin. This version will be immutable and will show up in [Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/) if the plugin is marked as public. Allow up to 1 hour for the Hub to reflect the changes.
