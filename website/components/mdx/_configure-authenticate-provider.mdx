## Authenticate with the Cloud Provider

CloudQuery uses similar authentication methods to the official SDKs of each cloud provider.
The AWS authentication guide is located [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/README.md).

You can find authentication for other plugins in their corresponding [READMEs](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source).
