## Configure Source Plugin

Source plugins define the APIs you want to sync from (See [available sources](/docs/plugins/sources/overview)).

For example, let's configure the [AWS](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/aws) source plugin.
Create an `aws.yml` file in your `cloudquery-config` directory:

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  ## Required. name of the plugin to use.
  ## This should be unique if you have number of aws plugins.
  name: "aws"
  ## Optional. Where to search for the plugin. Default: "github". Options: "github", "local", "grpc"
  # registry: "github"

  ## Path for the plugin.
  ## If registry is "github" path should be "repo/name"
  ## If registry is "local", path is path to binary. If "grpc" then it should be address of the plugin (usually useful in debug).
  path: "cloudquery/aws"

  ## Required. Must be a specific version starting with v, e.g. v1.2.3
  ## checkout latest versions here https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases?q=plugins-source-aws&expanded=true
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"

  ## Required. You can use ["*"] to sync all tables or specify specific tables. Please note that syncing all tables can be slow
  ## See all tables: https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/plugins/sources/aws/tables
  tables: ["aws_s3_buckets"]

  ## Required. all destinations you want to sync data to.
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  spec:
    ## Optional. plugin specific configuration
    ## By default will use the current aws credentials available (just like AWS CLI)
    ## See all available options here: https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/docs/configuration.md
```

- All general options for source spec you can find under [references/source-spec](/docs/reference/source-spec).
- All options for `aws` source plugin spec you can find [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/docs/configuration.md)

<Callout>

If you have multiple source plugins (or running multiple cloudquery instances in parallel), it's required
that every plugin configuration has a unique `name` (e.g. `aws1`, `aws2`, â€¦).

Running multiple plugins with the same name can cause unexpected behavior (e.g. empty tables). 

You can read more [here](/docs/advanced-topics/running-cloudquery-in-parallel).
