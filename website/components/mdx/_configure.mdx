## Configure Destination Plugin

Destination plugins define where you will be syncing your data to (See: [available destinations](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

For example, let's configure the [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/destination/postgresql) destination plugin
(See all available versions [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases?q=plugins-destination-postgresql&expanded=true)).
Create a file in a new directory `cloudquery-config/postgresql.yml`: 

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  ## Required. name of the plugin.
  ## This is an alias so it should be unique if you have a number of postgresql destination plugins.
  name: "postgresql"

  ## Optional. Where to search for the plugin. Default: "github". Options: "github", "local", "grpc".
  # registry: "github"

  ## Path for the plugin.
  ## If registry is "github" path should be "repo/name"
  ## If registry is "local", path is path to binary. If "grpc" then it should be address of the plugin (usually useful in debug).
  path: "cloudquery/postgresql"

  ## Required. Must be a specific version starting with v, e.g. v1.2.3
  ## checkout latest versions here https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases?q=plugins-destination-postgresql&expanded=true
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL"

  ## Optional. Default: "overwrite-delete-stale". Available: "overwrite-delete-stale", "overwrite", "append". 
  ##  Not all modes are supported by all plugins, so make sure to check the plugin documentation for more details.
  write_mode: "overwrite-delete-stale" # overwrite-delete-stale, overwrite, append

  spec:
    ## plugin-specific configuration for PostgreSQL.
    ## See all available options here: https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/destination/postgresql#postgresql-spec

    ## Required. Connection string to your PostgreSQL instance
    ## In production it is highly recommended to use environment variable expansion
    ## connection_string: ${PG_CONNECTION_STRING}
    connection_string: "postgresql://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
```

- All general options for destination spec you can find under [references/destination-spec](/docs/reference/destination-spec).
- All options for `postgresql` destination plugin spec you can find [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/destination/postgresql#postgresql-spec)

For a list of all available destination plugin spec options, see [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

<Callout>

If you have multiple destination plugins (or running multiple cloudquery instances in parallel), it's required
that every plugin configuration has a unique `name` (e.g. `postgres1`, `postgres2`, …).

## Configure Source Plugin

Source plugins define the APIs you want to sync from (See [available sources](/docs/plugins/sources/overview)).

For example, let's configure the [AWS](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/aws) source plugin.
Create an `aws.yml` file in your `cloudquery-config` directory:

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  ## Required. name of the plugin to use.
  ## This should be unique if you have number of aws plugins.
  name: "aws"
  ## Optional. Where to search for the plugin. Default: "github". Options: "github", "local", "grpc"
  # registry: "github"

  ## Path for the plugin.
  ## If registry is "github" path should be "repo/name"
  ## If registry is "local", path is path to binary. If "grpc" then it should be address of the plugin (usually useful in debug).
  path: "cloudquery/aws"

  ## Required. Must be a specific version starting with v, e.g. v1.2.3
  ## checkout latest versions here https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases?q=plugins-source-aws&expanded=true
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"

  ## Optional. Default: ["*"] - all tables. We recommend to specify specific tables that you need to sync as this
  ## will reduce the amount of data synced and improve performance.
  ## See all tables: https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/docs/tables/README.md
  # tables: ["*"]

  ## Required. all destinations you want to sync data to.
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  spec:
    ## Optional. plugin specific configuration
    ## By default will use the current aws credentials available (just like AWS CLI)
    ## See all available options here: https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/docs/configuration.md
```

- All general options for source spec you can find under [references/source-spec](/docs/reference/source-spec).
- All options for `aws` source plugin spec you can find [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/docs/configuration.md)

<Callout>

If you have multiple source plugins (or running multiple cloudquery instances in parallel), it's required
that every plugin configuration has a unique `name` (e.g. `aws1`, `aws2`, …).

Running multiple plugins with the same name can cause unexpected behavior (e.g. empty tables). 

You can read more [here](/docs/advanced-topics/running-cloudquery-in-parallel).

</Callout>

## Authenticate with the Cloud Provider

CloudQuery uses similar authentication methods to the official SDKs of each cloud provider.
The AWS authentication guide is located [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/main/plugins/source/aws/README.md).

You can find authentication for other plugins in their corresponding [READMEs](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source).

## Start Syncing

Now you can start syncing the data from your source plugins to the specified destinations.

You can sync the by specifying a directory with the configuration files or specify files directly

```bash copy
cloudquery sync ./cloudquery-config

# or cloudquery sync cloudquery-config/aws.yml cloudquery-config/postgresql.yml
```

You should see a spinner with number of resources synced and the time it took to sync.
Once the sync is done you can query the data via the database directly.

Note: All logs are written by default to `cloudquery.log` so you can easily see if any APIs failed and analyse those further.
