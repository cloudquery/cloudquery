## Sign in with CloudQuery

We recommend that you authenticate using the CloudQuery CLI. Once signed in, you can use CloudQuery with premium plugins up to a free quota and premium plugins in preview without limitations.

Authenticated users also have higher rate limits on plugin downloads than anonymous users.

You will be able to create a new account when you sign in with the CLI for the first time. Alternatively, head to [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io) to create a new account.

To sign in from the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
cloudquery login
```
A new browser window will open where you will complete the sign-in process.

For a non-interactive sign-in process and sync, you can [generate an API key](/docs/deployment/generate-api-key). This is useful for production deployments.
