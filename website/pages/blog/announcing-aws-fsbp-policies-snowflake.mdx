We are excited to announce the launch of CloudQuery’s newest security controls framework: The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) for Snowflake.

With this release, CloudQuery customers can now run the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices controls on their AWS configuration and infrastructure data stored in Snowflake.  This release contains over 200 controls with coverage for more than 40 AWS services.

## Background

The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices [were first launched in 2020](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-foundational-security-best-practices-standard-now-available-security-hub/) by AWS with an initial set of 31 automated security controls that align with AWS Security Best Practices.  Now, there are [more than 200 controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html) with coverage for more than 40 AWS services.  

By using CloudQuery, customers can sync infrastructure data from multiple sources to multiple destinations.  [CloudQuery enables customers to sync infrastructure data from AWS to Snowflake](https://www.cloudquery.io/integrations/aws/snowflake), a popular data destination.

## AWS Service Coverage

The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices covers over 40 services, including the following AWS Services.  For a full list of services and controls, check out [AWS’s documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html) or our [policies page](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/core-concepts/policies#aws-foundational-security-for-snowflake).
