We are thrilled to announce the release of the new SDK Version, which brings exciting enhancements to writing CloudQuery plugins!

# Overview

Let's begin with a high-level summary before diving deeper into each of the updates:

- **[Apache Arrow](./adopting_apache_arrow_at_cloudquery)** - SDK V4 now fully adopts Apache Arrow, a feature introduced in the pre SDK V4 release, SDK V3.
- **Unified Protocol for Sources and Destinations** - We have streamlined both the gRPC protocol and SDK API to utilize a single protocol. This allows CloudQuery plugins to function as both sources and destinations simultaneously, simplifying gRPC versioning and updates.
- **Transition to Streaming API** - We have transitioned the `Sync` and `Write` operations to a streaming-based API, enabling new use cases like Change Data Capture (CDC).

## Apache Arrow

We extensively discussed this update in our previous [blog post](./adopting_apache_arrow_at_cloudquery).
Now, with all our [destinations](../docs/plugins/destinations/overview) migrated to SDK V4, they support over 30 different [Apache Arrow data types](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/datatypes.html)!

## Unified Protocol

The updates to the [SDK](https://github.com/cloudquery/plugin-sdk) and [proto-buf](https://github.com/cloudquery/plugin-pb) are vital for introducing new features and enhancing the developer experience for plugin authors and end users.

Having a single protocol version ensures better manageability of upgrades and maintains backward compatibility, providing users and developers with ample time for transitioning.
It also enables plugin authors to create plugins that function as both sources and destinations.

Moreover, any of the CloudQuery destinations can now be utilized as backends for [incremental syncs](docs/core-concepts/syncs#incremental-table-syncs).

For example, You can now specify the following for sources with incremental syncs:

```
backend_options:
  table_name: "test_state_table"
  connection: "@@plugins.postgresql.connection"
```

`@@plugins.X` can reference any of the destinations specified in your config.

## Streaming API

One noteworthy use case on top of CloudQuery is Change Data Capture (CDC), which involves operations like creating or deleting tables during a sync.
With the new streaming support, the `Write` method now supports multiple messages, such as `CreateTable`, and can easily accommodate new messages to enhance and facilitate such use cases.

# Summary

We are thrilled about this major release! Don't hesitate to try your hand at developing a new CloudQuery plugin. Feel free to reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) or [Discord](https://cloudquery.io/discord) with any questions or feedback.
