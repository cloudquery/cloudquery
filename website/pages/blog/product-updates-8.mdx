Hey everyone! Our monthly round-up of CloudQuery product and roadmap updates is here!

TLDR:

- Open source: A new SDK, new plugins, performance improvements
- Premium (closed source): New policies

## SDKs!

ICYMI, we published [Python](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/announcing-cloudquery-python-sdk) and [JavaScript](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/announcing-cloudquery-javascript-sdk) SDKs last month and this month, we followed with Java!

- Check out our [Java announcement blog](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/announcing-cloudquery-java-sdk)!
- Creating a [Java source](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/developers/creating-new-plugin/java-source)

## Sources

### New Source Plugins

- [Bitbucket](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/plugins/sources/bitbucket/overview) - First plugin utilizing our Java SDK!
- [Notion](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/notion) - Loads databases, pages, and users from Notion to any database, data warehouse or data lake supported by CloudQuery, such as PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Athena, and many more.
- You can now configure the API version on the [Shopify](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/plugins/sources/shopify/overview) plugin.

### AWS, GCP, Azure Highlights

- We launched a closed beta for event-based sync with the AWS plugin. This helps with keeping your data fresh without running full syncs. [Sign up for beta](https://cloudquery.typeform.com/to/Dvdn6P2u) or [read the full announcement](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/announcing-cloudquery-aws-event-based-sync-beta) first.

- AWS has got a new scheduler strategy that reduces the number of concurrent calls made to the account contact APIs in syncs with multiple tables. Read more about this in our documentation on [performance tuning](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/advanced-topics/performance-tuning#use-a-different-scheduler).

Check out the full changelog for [AWS](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/97d86a5c282e587420c1abd714bb0218d9c86f5a/plugins/source/aws/CHANGELOG.md),
[GCP](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/97d86a5c282e587420c1abd714bb0218d9c86f5a/plugins/source/gcp/CHANGELOG.md) and [Azure](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/97d86a5c282e587420c1abd714bb0218d9c86f5a/plugins/source/azure/CHANGELOG.md)
