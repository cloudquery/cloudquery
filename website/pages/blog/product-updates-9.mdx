Hey everyone! Our monthly round-up of CloudQuery product and roadmap updates is here! Here are the main highlights:

- We have launched the Hub!
- CloudQuery is now an official [Google Partner](/blog/announcing-gcp-partnership).
- We are on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/cloudquery/reviews) and we would love to see your feedback there!

## Sources

### AWS, GCP, Azure Highlights

- AWS: Added `aws_ec2_vpc_endpoint_connections` table.
- AWS: Added `aws_lambda_function_url_configs` table.
- GCP: Added `gcp_networkconnectivity_locations` and `gcp_networkconnectivity_internal_ranges`. Shout-out to [shani1998](https://github.com/shani1998) for their contribution!
- K8S: Added `k8s_core_pod_templates` table for `PodTemplate` k8s resource. Shout-out to [cychiang](https://github.com/cychiang) for their contribution!

## Destinations

The Neo4j destination plugin `v5.0.0` now supports creating & recreating (range) indexes for tables with primary keys. This significantly increases data load speed & enables users to perform comparisons on the primary key columns. See more information in the [Neo4j documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-search-performance/).

## SDKs

In September, we launched SDKs for JavaScript, Java, and Python. We have now created more content to help you get started using these: Learn how to create new plugins either with [Python (video walkthrough)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSbGHz5Z09M) or [JavaScript (blog post)](/blog/creating-a-new-js-plugin).

## CLI

The new `cloudquery plugin install` command makes building Docker images easier: it can be used to download plugins based on the provided config without the need to run a sync or migration with the plugin.

Read more about how to use it to build a container with plugins in our [Deployment documentation](/docs/deployment/docker-offline)

Read the [documentation](/docs/reference/cli/cloudquery_plugin_install) on the new command.

## Community Hours

We are excited to announce that we are starting a new series of CloudQuery Community Hours!

Join us for a live chat on November 29, at 10 AM EST (3 PM UTC). We will talk about our recent updates to CloudQuery, share our plans for the future, answer any questions you might have, and take any feedback you want to share.

## Blog
