Today, we're excited to announce the availability of [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io).

In the 6 month since CloudQuery release, we saw amazing growth and adoption from the community, with our [open-source project](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) reaching 1.6K stars. This validates the need for a standard and open-source way to query, monitor and analyze cloud infrastructure for visibility, security, compliance and cost challenges to help put the order back in place.

Two months ago we released [CloudQuery SDK](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/introducing-cloudquery-sdk) to enable developers easily [extend](/docs/developers/creating-new-plugin) CloudQuery with their own maintained providers. As a natural next step we are releasing [CloudQuery Hub](https://www.cloudquery.io).

## What is CloudQuery Hub?

CloudQuery Hub provides Documentation, collaboration and workflow for developers, SREs and users. A few key features that we rolled-out with our first version includes:

- Automated table documentation generation using CloudQuery SDK.
- Git-backed version control documentation exposed and browsable via CloudQuery Hub for each version.
- Automated documentation build service - Each registered provider (both official and community) has their documentation updated on each release automatically.
- Easily search for tables in each provider, so you will be able build the queries you need efficiently.

## What the future looks like?

This is just the initial release of CloudQuery hub, and we are working on some more exciting features, so subscribe to our newsletter, [twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudqueryio) and stay tuned!
