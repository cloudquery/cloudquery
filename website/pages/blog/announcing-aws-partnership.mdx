We are excited to announce that CloudQuery has officially been recognized as a [member of the AWS Partner Network](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/0010h00001kNW07AAG).  From this partnership program, we're looking forward to continued development on extracting, transforming, and loading data from AWS APIs to a variety of supported destinations that include databases, data lakes, and streaming platforms for further analysis.  CloudQuery supports multiple use cases built on top of this data platform including security, cost optimization, infrastructure, and development.

## Highlights

* Part of the partner process involved us working with AWS to complete multiple steps including an AWS Foundational Technical Review to ensure our offerings meet AWS's stringent technical requirements and provide value to customers.
