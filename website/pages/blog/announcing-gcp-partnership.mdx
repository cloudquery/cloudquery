We are excited to announce that CloudQuery has officially been recognized as a [member of the GCP Partner Advantage Program](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/cloudquery) as a Technology Build Partner.  

Google Cloud Build Partners are companies that create solutions that integrate with or run on Google Cloud to complement or enhance GCP products.  Additionally, Partner solutions are qualified by Google and authorized prior to becoming recognized as a member of the GCP Partner Advantage Program.

From this partnership program, we're looking forward to continued value delivery to customers by extracting, transforming, and loading data from GCP APIs to a variety of supported destinations that include databases, data lakes, and streaming platforms for further analysis.  CloudQuery supports multiple use cases built on top of this data platform including security, cost optimization, infrastructure, and development.
