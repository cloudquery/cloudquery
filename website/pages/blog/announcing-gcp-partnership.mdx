We are excited to announce that CloudQuery has officially been recognized as a [member of the Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/cloudquery) as a Technology Build Partner.  

Google Cloud Build Partners are companies that create solutions that integrate with or run on Google Cloud to complement or enhance Google Cloud products.  Additionally, Partner solutions are qualified by Google Cloud and authorized prior to becoming recognized as a member of the Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program.

From this partnership program, we're looking forward to continued value delivery to customers by extracting, transforming, and loading data from Google Cloud APIs to a variety of supported destinations that include databases, data lakes, and streaming platforms for further analysis.  CloudQuery supports multiple use cases built on top of this data platform including security, cost optimization, infrastructure, and development.

We have an exciting roadmap ahead of new features and improvements.  Stay tuned!
