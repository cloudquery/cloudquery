Following the launch of [CloudQuery Hub](https://docs.cloudquery.io/blog/announcing-cloudquery-new-hub) last month and premium plugins,
We are excited to announce that we are opening registration for early access for 3rd party developers who are interested in 
developing and selling plugins, transformations and visualizations on CloudQuery Hub.

## Key Details

- Only Go plugins are currently supported for 3rd party developers to sell on CQ Hub (
  We will support eventually all other CQ SDK languages such as Python/Java/Javascript)
- Plugins are billed on a usage-based pricing model, with a charge of $X per 1 million rows per month, as determined by the developer.
- Transformations and visualizations incur a one-time fee every six months, which includes support and updates for that period.
- CloudQuery handles billing, usage, and metering, and charges a 30% commission on each sale.
- **Early Registration discount**: Those who register by the end of Q1 2024 can redeem a 15% discount on commission fees until the end of 2024.

Registration is now open [here](https://docs.cloudquery.io/register-for-marketplace)!
