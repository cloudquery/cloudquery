In this guide, we will walk you through how to set up [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) to build your own customizable compliance, CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) dashboard with PostgreSQL and Grafana.

CSPMs are probably the biggest offenders of yet-another-dashboard syndrome, and at CloudQuery we believe it’s time to unbundle those, applying the best practices in data engineering and the modern data stack to cloud security.

## General Architecture

- **ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) ingestion layer:** [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery)
- **Datastore:** PostgreSQL
- **Policies:** Standard [SQL Policies](/docs/core-concepts/policies) to be executed via `psql`
- **Data Visualization and Exploration Platform:** Grafana

## What you will get

- **Raw SQL access** to all your cloud asset inventory, open source SQL based policies.
- **Multi-Cloud Asset Inventory:** Ingest configuration from all your clouds to a single datastore with a unified structure.
- **Avoid yet-another-dashboard fatigue:** Reuse your existing BI/Visualization stack (Grafana in this example) to build an open source CSPM.

### Step 1: **Install or Deploy CloudQuery**

If it’s your first time using CloudQuery we suggest you first run it locally to get familiar with the tool. Take a look at our [quick start guide](/docs/quickstart).

If you are already familiar with CloudQuery, take a look at how to deploy it to AWS on RDS Aurora and EKS at [github.com/cludquery/terraform-aws-cloudquery](https://github.com/cloudquery/terraform-aws-cloudquery) , or GCP and Cloud SQL at [https://github.com/cloudquery/terraform-gcp-cloudquery](https://github.com/cloudquery/terraform-gcp-cloudquery)

### Step 2: **Install Grafana**

Grafana is a well-known open source observability and visualization tool. It is open source, so there are a number of ways to deploy it:

- **Self-hosted (local, docker, k8s):** [Official guide.](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/)
- **SaaS/managed:** [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com/)
- AWS Managed Grafana: [https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/)

### Step 3: Run Policies (CSPM - Cloud Security Posture Management)

CloudQuery policies and rules are implemented in pure SQL and they store results in a single table that you can easily query and visualize. Here is a [link](/docs/core-concepts/policies) to all available policies and compliance frameworks. In this section we will go quickly through how to run multiple benchmarks for AWS.

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery.git
cd cloudquery/plugins/source/aws/policies
# change the DSN to your PostgreSQL instance populated by CloudQuery
psql postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres -f policy.sql
```

This should run all [available](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/policies) compliance framework and store the results in [aws_policy_results](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/policies). Now you can query the table directly and export in various formats such as CSV or HTML, all with standard `psql` , and of course visualize them in your favorite BI tool. We prepared a pre-built dashboard for Grafana that you can check out [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/aws/dashboards):

## Summary

That’s it! Now you have fully functional CSPM (KSPM, or any other SPM) with those nice bonuses:

1. Access to raw data available and stored in your PostgreSQL.

2. Policies easily customizable and defined in pure SQL.
