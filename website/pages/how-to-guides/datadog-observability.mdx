In this guide we will discuss how to leverage [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) to add observability to CloudQuqery sync jobs.
A common use case for CloudQuery is to run it as a scheduled job to sync cloud resources to data warehouse, or even multiple jobs each with a different configuration.
In order to get insights into runs of sync jobs, we can use [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) to monitor the sync jobs and get alerts when something goes wrong.

## Prerequisites

- A Datadog account. See [here](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for getting started
- The Datadog agent installed in the machine(s) running the CloudQuery sync jobs. See [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) for more information
- Log collection enabled in the Datadog agent configuration. See [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/logs/?tab=tailfiles#activate-log-collection) for more information

## Adding a Custom Log Source for CloudQuery Logs

First we recommended passing the `--log-format json` flag to the CloudQuery sync command. This ensures that the logs are in a structured format that Datadog can parse.
Datadog can collect logs in non JSON format as well, but using JSON format ensure that we can query the logs.

Now, let's create the custom log source in Datadog:

1. Locate the Datadog `conf.d` directory. You can find the location of the directory based on our OS in the Datadog documentation [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/agent-configuration-files/?tab=agentv6v7#agent-configuration-directory).
2. Under the `conf.d` directory create a directory named `cloudquery.d`
3. Under the `cloudquery.d` directory create a file named `conf.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: "file"
    path: "<full path to the CloudQuery log file>" # Example path: /var/log/cloudquery/cloudquery.log
    service: "CloudQuery"
    source: "CloudQuery"
```

4. [Restart](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/agent-commands/?tab=agentv6v7#restart-the-agent) the Datadog agent for changes to take effect.

## Using Datadog to query CloudQuery logs

Once you run a CloudQuery sync job, you should see the logs in the [Datadog logs explorer](https://us5.datadoghq.com/logs):

If you don't see any logs you might need to chose a different time range in the Datadog logs explorer:

By using JSON format we can immediately query the logs in Datadog.

For example the `@errors:>0 @table:*` query filters all tables that had errors during the sync job:
![Datadog logs explorer query](/images/how-to-guides/datadog-observability/datadog_logs_explorer_errors_query.png)

And the `@resources:>10000 @table:*` query filters all tables that had more than 10,000 resources during the sync job:

## Summary and Next Steps

In this guide we created a custom log source in Datadog to collect CloudQuery logs and query them.

Datadog is a powerful tool for monitoring and observability and we only scratched the surface of what you can do with it.
We recommend reading the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/) to learn more about its capabilities, for example creating [monitors](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/) and [dashboards](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/).
