## Introduction

In a [previous guide](www.cloudquery.io/how-to-guides/how-to-load-infrastructure-data-into-athena), we talked about how to load infrastructure data into Amazon Athena.  In this tutorial, we will show you how to load AWS's Cost and Usage Reports into Amazon Athena and enrich infrastructure data with the data provided by Cost and Usage Reports.  This will enable you to query your data and execute different cost optimization and FinOps use cases to understand and manage the financials of your cloud infrastructure.

## Walkthrough

### 1. Infrastructure Data Prerequisites

We've already followed the previous guide to load infrastructure data into Amazon Athena via CloudQuery.  If you haven't done so already, follow the [CloudQuery guide](www.cloudquery.io/how-to-guides/how-to-load-infrastructure-data-into-athena).  

After completing the guide above, you should have the following completed:

* CloudQuery syncing data from AWS to S3.
* The ability to query data in Athena.

### 2. Start Gathering Cost and Usage Reports

To set up Cost and Usage Reports, we'll follow AWS documentation for how to set up the infrastructure necessary for Cost and Usage Reports.

By the end of this step, we'll have created the following:
* A S3 Bucket to hold our Cost and Usage Reports.
* A new Cost and Usage Report.

Let's start by [creating a new S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/cur-s3.html) for our Cost and Usage Reports.  AWS's `billingreports.amazonaws.com` will deliver these reports to our new S3 Bucket.  Keep in mind that it may take up to 24 hours for AWS to start delivering reports to the Amazon S3 bucket.  If you are creating a fresh S3 bucket, we suggest creating the bucket and coming back the next day to complete the rest of this guide!  Storing the billing reports data in Amazon S3 will incur standard [S3 costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/billing-cur-limits.html).  

You should see multiple files in the S3 bucket once the cost and usage reports have been successfully delivered to your S3 bucket. In the billing console, the cost and usage report created will also show a time stamp for `Data last refreshed` such as the screenshot below.

### 3. Sync Cost and Usage Reports to Athena

Now that we have successfully created an S3 Bucket to receive Cost and Usage Reports


For this step, we'll use the CloudFormation template that [AWS generates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/use-athena-cf.html) in the bucket we previously created for Cost and Usage Reports.

```bash copy
aws cloudformation create-stack \
--stack-name cost-and-usage-crawler \
--template-url https://cq-demo-cur.s3.amazonaws.com/cost-and-usage/jason-demo-reports/crawler-cfn.yml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM 
--region us-east-1
```

Remember to replace the `template-url` parameter with the object URL for the CloudFormation template that AWS created in the Cost and Usage S3 Bucket.  

This template creates the following resources: 
* 3 IAM Roles
* An AWS Glue Database
* An AWS Glue crawler
* 2 Lambda functions
* An Amazon S3 notification

As needed, adjust the CloudFormation template depending on your organizational requirements such as required IAM controls, tags, and encryption settings.

You should now see 2 databases loaded in Amazon Athena:
* CloudQuery Data
* AWS Cost and Usage Reports

We can run the following query [to validate that Athena is ready](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/cur-ate-run.html) for queries on the Cost and Usage data.  A status of `READY` means we can query the Athena database.  If the status is `UPDATING`, Athena may return incomplete results.

```sql copy
SELECT * 
FROM "athenacurcfn_jason_demo_reports"."cost_and_usage_data_status"
```

### 4. Run Athena Queries on Infrastructure and Cost Data

Let's start by looking at our biggest expenses:

** Show biggest expenses and correlate with resources.  Note, by including the `line_item_resource_id!=''` in our Athena query, we exclude cost of items that are not directly associated with resource IDs such as cost for AWS Support.

```sql copy
SELECT 
  line_item_resource_id, 
  line_item_product_code,
  sum(line_item_blended_cost) AS cost, 
  month
FROM "athenacurcfn_jason_demo_reports"."jason_demo_reports"
WHERE year='2023' and line_item_resource_id!=''
GROUP BY line_item_resource_id, line_item_product_code, month
HAVING sum(line_item_blended_cost) > 0
ORDER BY cost DESC;
```

![Results from Athena Query showing resources correlated with most expensive cost per month](/images/how-to-guides/query-aws-cost-and-usage-athena/athena-cost-usage.png)


Now let's look at one straightforward method to reduce costs by using more cost-effective EBS volume types.

** Use gp3 volumes instead of gp2 volumes for Amazon EBS.
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/migrate-your-amazon-ebs-volumes-from-gp2-to-gp3-and-save-up-to-20-on-costs/

```sql copy
SELECT 
  costquery.line_item_resource_id, 
  costquery.cost, 
  vols.volume_type, 
  vols.attachments, 
  vols.arn, 
  vols.tags, 
  vols.state, 
  vols.snapshot_id, 
  vols.size, 
  vols.create_time
FROM (
	SELECT 
	  line_item_resource_id, line_item_product_code, 
    SUM(line_item_blended_cost) AS cost, month
	FROM "athenacurcfn_jason_demo_reports"."jason_demo_reports"
	WHERE 
    year='2023' and line_item_resource_id!='' and line_item_resource_id LIKE 'vol-%'
	GROUP BY 
    line_item_resource_id, line_item_product_code, 
    month
	HAVING SUM(line_item_blended_cost) > 0
	ORDER BY cost DESC
) as costquery 
LEFT JOIN
"cloudquery-athena-example-json"."aws_ec2_ebs_volumes" as vols
ON costquery.line_item_resource_id = vols.volume_id
WHERE vols.volume_type = 'gp2'
```

** Correlate Groups of Resources based off Tags

** Search by a CloudFormation Stack (Maybe)
