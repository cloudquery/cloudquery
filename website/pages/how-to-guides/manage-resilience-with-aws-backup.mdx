In this guide, we'll walkthrough how to use CloudQuery to manage a company resilience strategy utilizing AWS Backup to protect against data loss, support backup and recovery initiatives, and ensure compliance.

AWS Backup is a fully managed service that can be used for data protection at scale.  By using CloudQuery, we can:
* Manage AWS Backup at scale across multiple AWS accounts.
* Monitor status of AWS Backup and compliance with company strategies or requirements.
* Monitor overall health of AWS Backup including failures, issues, and successes.
* Manage AWS Backup settings and reduce data protection issues.

An example AWS Backup Health Dashboard Powered by CloudQuery and Grafana is shown below.  More information can be found [here](/register_for_cloud).

## Walkthrough

We'll use the following components for our architecture:
* AWS (Amazon Web Services) for infrastructure source
* CloudQuery for ETL
* PostgreSQL as the destination
* Grafana for a visualization layer

CloudQuery supports [many more destinations](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview) and visualization layers that can be used in place of PostgreSQL and Grafana.  

### Prerequisites

* AWS Account(s) with AWS Backup
* PostgreSQL 
* Grafana

### Step 1: Install or Deploy CloudQuery

To get started with CloudQuery, additional information can be found in our [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/macOS).

### Step 2: Sync Data from AWS to PostgreSQL

In this reference, we'll sync data about AWS Backup, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS EC2.  CloudQuery can be customized to sync data from other [infrastructure in AWS](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/tables) as needed.

Additional information on configuring CloudQuery to sync from AWS can be found [in our documentation](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/configuration) as well as additional information on how to configure CloudQuery to [sync from multiple AWS Accounts](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/multi-account).

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: aws
  path: cloudquery/aws
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"
  tables: 
    - aws_backup_*
    - aws_s3_buckets
    - aws_dynamodb_*
    - aws_ec2_instances
  destinations: ["DESTINATION_NAME"]
  spec: 
    # AWS Spec section described below
    regions: 
      - us-east-1
    accounts:
      - id: "account1"
        local_profile: "account1-profile"
```

### Step 3: Set up Grafana for Visualization

If Grafana isn't setup yet for visualization, follow this guide:


### Step 4: Run Queries 

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM aws_backup_jobs
WHERE state='FAILED';
```

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM aws_backup_protected_resources;
```

```sql
SELECT resource_type, COUNT(arn), account_id 
FROM aws_backup_protected_resources
GROUP BY resource_type, account_id;
```

### Step 5: Create Custom Visualizations and Dashboards
