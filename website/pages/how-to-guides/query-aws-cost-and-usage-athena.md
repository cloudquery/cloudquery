## Introduction

In a (previous guide)[www.cloudquery.io/how-to-guides/how-to-load-infrastructure-data-into-athena], we talked about how to load infrastructure data into Amazon Athena.  In this tutorial, we will show you how to load AWS's Cost and Usage Reports into Amazon Athena and enrich infrastructure data with the data provided by Cost and Usage Reports.  This will enable you to query your data and execute different cost optimization and FinOps use cases to understand financials of your cloud infrastructure.

## Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Data Prerequisites



### 2. Start Gathering Cost and Usage Reports



### 3. Sync Cost and Usage Reports to Athena




### 4. Run Athena Queries on Infrastructure and Cost Data
