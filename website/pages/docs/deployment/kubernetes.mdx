# Deploying CloudQuery using Kubernetes CronJobs

In this tutorial we will set up a Kubernetes CronJob to run CloudQuery Sync on a regular schedule.
Due to its flexibility and standardization across cloud providers, Kubernetes is commonly used by DevOps & Platform Engineers when deploying workloads and microservices.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes Cluster
- A Postgres Database server
- Credentials (with Read privileges) for a supported API - in the example we'll use a DigitalOcean account

## Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Secret for your API Keys

To keep our credentials separate from our manifests, we need to create a secret that we'll use to supply our environment variables
We can do this in a single command:

```bash copy
kubectl create secret generic cloudquery-secret \
--from-literal=DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=<your_token> \
--from-literal=SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key> \
--from-literal=SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key> \
--from-literal=PG_CONNECTION_STR=<your_postgres_connection_string>
```

## Step 2: Create the CronJob Manifest

A CronJob is a Kubernetes object that allows you to run a job on a schedule.
It's similar to a Kubernetes Workload, except that it is intended for Jobs (short-lived containers) that conduct a task and then shutdown, instead of Pods (long-lived containers intended for services).

The CronJob manifest has two key elements, the `jobTemplate`, and the `schedule`.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cloudquery
  labels:
    app: cloudquery
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  jobTemplate: {}
```

The Schedule expression follows the same format as crontab; that is a space separated list as follows `minute hour day(of month) month day(of week)`.
Which in the above example would be midnight (i.e. 00:00) every day.

<Callout type="info">
To learn more about cron schedule expressions, check out https://crontab.guru/ or the Kubernetes documentation https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/
</Callout>

The `jobTemplate` describes what to run, how to run it, and any volumes that it needs.

As this follows the same structure as a Kubernetes Workload, we won't go too deep into the details here.

```yaml copy
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cloudquery
  labels:
    app: cloudquery
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: cloudquery
              image: ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              args: ["sync", "/config/config.yml", "--log-console", "--log-format", "json"]
              envFrom:
                - secretRef:
                    name: cloudquery-secret
              volumeMounts:
              - name: config
                mountPath: "/config"
                readOnly: true
          restartPolicy: Never
          volumes:
          - name: config
            configMap:
              name: cloudquery-config
              items:
              - key: "config"
                path: "config.yml"
```

Looking at this completed manifest, there are three key elements to pay attention to: `args`, `envFrom`, `volumes`

In the `args`, you'll see the arguments to be passed to cloudquery, in `envFrom` you're instructing Kubernetes to use the secret you created earlier, and in `volumes` you're telling Kubernetes where to find the config file.

## Step 3: Defining the ConfigMap to hold the CloudQuery Config

When using Kubernetes config files are commonly stored on a special type of object called a ConfigMap.
ConfigMaps enable you to define collections of text files that can be mounted as directories by Pods and Jobs.

A ConfigMap definition is relatively simple, containing a `data` object where files are defined as key-value pairs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cloudquery-config
data: {}
```

In this case, you want to define a ConfigMap to store a CloudQuery config file, that defines a Source plugin and a Destination plugin.

```yaml copy
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cloudquery-config
data:
  config: |
    kind: source
    spec:
      # Source spec section
      name: digitalocean
      path: cloudquery/digitalocean
      version: "v5.0.2"
      tables:
        - "digitalocean_droplets"
        - "digitalocean_databases"
        - "digitalocean_accounts"
        - "digitalocean_storage_volumes"
        - "digitalocean_floating_ips"
        - "digitalocean_firewalls"
        - "digitalocean_load_balancers"
        - "digitalocean_billing_history"
      destinations: ["postgresql"]
    ---
    kind: destination
    spec:
      name: "postgresql"
      registry: "github"
      path: "cloudquery/postgresql"
      version: "v4.2.2"
      spec:
        connection_string: ${PG_CONNECTION_STR}
```

In this example we're using the DigitalOcean source plugin and the Postgres destination plugin. But you can find out more about building config files and integrations [here](https://www.cloudquery.io/integrations).

## Step 4: Apply the manifest

Apply the config from a terminal using `kubectl apply`

```bash copy
kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml -f configmap.yaml
```

## Step 5: Query the data

You can manually trigger the cronjob to run early using:

```bash copy
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<name of cronjob> <name of job>
```

After which you can query your SQL database to see the results.
