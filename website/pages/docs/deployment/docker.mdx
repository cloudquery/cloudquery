# Docker

It is possible to use CloudQuery in an isolated container. You can pull the relevant image via `docker pull ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest`.

## Configuration

### Create a Config File on the Host Machine

CloudQuery uses YAML files as the primary means of configuration. A simple example `config.yml` file would look like:

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws
  path: cloudquery/aws
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"
  tables: ["aws_ec2_*"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: postgresql
  path: cloudquery/postgresql
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL"
  spec:
    connection_string: "postgres://postgres:pass@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
```

### Run the Container

For the CloudQuery docker container to use this configuration file you will need to mount the volume to the container like so:

```bash copy
docker run --pull always \
  -v <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>:/config.yml \
  # set any env variable with -e <ENV_VAR_NAME>=<ENV_VAR_VALUE>
  ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest \
  sync /config.yml
```

As with running any `cloudquery` command on your CLI you can override the config with the [optional flags](/docs/reference/cli/cloudquery) with the docker container. You will also need to make sure you load any ENV variables for source and destination plugins, such as your `AWS_*` keys etc.

If you split the configuration between multiple files, you can mount the directory containing them, instead of just the `config.yml` file.

If you are running Docker on an ARM Apple device and you see a segmentation fault when running the container like so `qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped`; please make sure you are running the latest Docker for Mac release.

## Caching

Due to the way `cloudquery` is [designed](/docs/developers/architecture) it downloads all the components to interact with source and destination plugins. This means that with a docker container it runs the download step each time, as the local cache is lost between executions. To avoid this we recommend mounting a volume to cache the data and configuring `cloudquery` to use this via the `--cq-dir` optional flag. An example of this would be:

```bash copy
docker run --pull always \
  -v <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>:/config.yml \
  -v <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CACHE_DIRECTORY>:/cache/.cq \
  # set any env variable with -e <ENV_VAR_NAME>=<ENV_VAR_VALUE>
  ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest \
  sync /config.yml --cq-dir /cache/.cq
```

<Callout type="info">

Depending on your operating system, the built components maybe different between your local system and the container. To avoid the different please use a separate cache directory for the container than a local instance of `cloudquery`.
