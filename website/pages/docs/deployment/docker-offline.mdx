# Docker - Offline Installation

You can run CloudQuery in a container with plugins pre-installed. This is useful for isolated deployments where you don't want to download plugins from the internet.

To download the plugins based on your configuration file, use the `cloudquery install` command. Below is an example `Dockerfile` based on the [CloudQuery container](/docs/deployment/docker). It uses a `build.spec.yaml` with the minimum configuration required to download the plugins.

```yaml
# build.spec.yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws
  path: cloudquery/aws
  version: "v22.14.0"
  tables: ["aws_ec2_instances"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "postgresql"
  registry: "github"
  path: "cloudquery/postgresql"
  version: "v6.0.8"
  spec:
```

```docker
# Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./build.spec.yaml /app/build.spec.yaml

RUN /app/cloudquery install cloudquery.yaml
```

Build this container as you would normally do:

```bash
docker build ./ -t my-cq-container:latest
```

### Run the Container

Run the container as you would run the default CloudQuery container. Here is an example:

```bash copy
docker run \
  # you can mount a different config file that uses the same plugins as in the build.spec 
  -v <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>:/config.yml \
  # set any env variable with -e <ENV_VAR_NAME>=<ENV_VAR_VALUE>
  my-cq-container:latest \
  sync /config.yml
```
