# Docker - Offline Installation

You can run CloudQuery in a container with plugins pre-installed. This is useful for isolated deployments where you don't want to download plugins from the internet.

Downloading plugins requires users to be authenticated, normally this means running `cloudquery login` but that is not doable in a CI environment or inside of a docker build process. The recommended way to handle this is to use an API key. More information on generating an API Key can be found [here](/docs/deployment/generate-api-key)

To download the plugins based on your configuration file, use the `cloudquery plugin install` command. Below is an example `Dockerfile` based on the [CloudQuery container](/docs/deployment/docker). It uses a `build.spec.yaml` with the minimum configuration required to download the plugins.


```yaml
# build.spec.yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws
  path: cloudquery/aws
  registry: cloudquery
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"
  tables: ["aws_ec2_instances"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "postgresql"
  path: "cloudquery/postgresql"
  registry: "cloudquery"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL"
  spec:
```

```docker
# Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./build.spec.yaml /app/build.spec.yaml
ARG CLOUDQUERY_API_KEY

RUN /app/cloudquery plugin install build.spec.yaml

FROM ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the .cq directory which contains the plugins
COPY --from=build /app/.cq /app/.cq
```

Build this container as you would normally do:

```bash
docker build --build-arg CLOUDQUERY_API_KEY=<your-api-key> ./ -t my-cq-container:latest
```

### Run the Container

Run the container as you would run the default CloudQuery container. Here is an example:

```bash copy
docker run \
  # you can mount a different config file that uses the same plugins as in the build.spec 
  -v <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>:/config.yml \
  # set any env variable with -e <ENV_VAR_NAME>=<ENV_VAR_VALUE>
  my-cq-container:latest \
  sync /config.yml
```
