# Generate a CloudQuery API Key

In automated environments, an API Key can be used with CloudQuery Hub and premium plugins instead of `cloudquery login`. 

Create an API key by following these steps:

1. Go to [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io) and log in or register for a new account.
2. If you are not already in a team, you will be prompted to create a new team.
3. Once you are logged in, click `Team Settings` in the left sidebar.
4. Go to the `API Keys` tab.

5. Click `Generate new key`

6. Choose a key name for you to identify this key by, and an expiration date. Then click `Generate new key`.

7. Copy the key and store it in a safe place. You will not be able to see it again after this step.

To use the API key with the CloudQuery CLI, set the `CLOUDQUERY_API_KEY` environment variable to the value of the key.

```bash
export CLOUDQUERY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```
