# Orchestrating CloudQuery Syncs with Kestra

In this tutorial, we will show you how to run CloudQuery as a [Kestra](https://kestra.io/) flow, using the AWS source- and Postgresql destination plugins as an example. Kestra is an open source orchestration tool that allows you to schedule and monitor CloudQuery syncs. 

## Step 1: Install Kestra

Follow the [Kestra Deployment with Docker guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/docker) to run Kestra locally inside Docker containers. 

When it's running, open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.  

## Step 2: Set up a PostgreSQL database

We will use a PostgreSQL database as a destination for our CloudQuery syncs. You can use any PostgreSQL database, but for this tutorial we will use a Docker container.

```bash copy
docker run --name cloudquery-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
``` 

## Step 2: Create a Kestra flow

Inside the Kestra UI, go to the `Flows` tab and click on `Create`. You can now create a new flow with the following content:

```yaml copy
id: "cloudquery"
namespace: "io.kestra"
tasks:
- id: "bash"
  type: "io.kestra.core.tasks.scripts.Bash"
  runner: DOCKER
  inputFiles:
    config.yml: |
      kind: source
      spec:
        name: aws
        path: cloudquery/aws
        version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"
        tables: ["aws_ec2*"]
        destinations: ["postgresql"]
        spec:
      ---
      kind: destination
      spec:
        name: "postgresql"
        version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL"
        path: "cloudquery/postgresql"
        write_mode: "overwrite-delete-stale"
        spec:
          connection_string: ${PG_CONNECTION_STRING}
  dockerOptions:
    image: ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest
    entryPoint: [""]
  warningOnStdErr: false
  env:
    PG_CONNECTION_STRING: "postgresql://postgres:pass@host.docker.internal:5432/cloudquery?sslmode=disable"
  commands:
  - '/app/cloudquery sync {{ workingDir }}/config.yml --log-console'
```

We are using the Docker runner with a `Bash` task to run the `cloudquery sync` command. The `inputFiles` section allows us to pass a configuration file to the task. It is also possible to read this configuration file from disk or a remote location, but we will keep it simple for now.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

<Callout type="info">
The example places the Postgres connection string in an environment variable. In production, you should use a secret manager like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to load the connection string into environment variables.
</Callout>

The AWS config is just an example. It is configured to sync all EC2 tables and their relations.

<Callout type="info">
In our example config we are using the Postgres host `host.docker.internal` to connect to the database. This is a special hostname that Docker resolves to the host machine. Make sure to replace this with the hostname of your database if you are not running Postgres via Docker.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Run the flow

With the config entered, click `Save`, then click `New Execution`. Click `OK` on the confirmation.

If everything was set up correctly, you should now see the sync running in the `Executions` tab. You can click on the execution to see the logs for any errors.

<Callout type="info">
If you get an error related to config.yml not being found, try making the following change to the Kestra Docker-compose file to give the volume write access:

```yaml
- /tmp/kestra-wd:/tmp/kestra-wd:rw
```
</Callout>

## Step 4: Schedule the flow

To run the flow periodically, we can add a trigger to run it on a schedule. Back in the Flow editor, add the following section:

```yaml copy
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "0 6 * * *"
```

This cron expression will run the flow every day at 06:00. You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to generate cron expressions for the destination you need and replace the one in the example above. Kestra also supports these special values for `cron`:

```text
@yearly
@annually
@monthly
@weekly
@daily
@midnight
@hourly
```

With this in place, remember to click `Save` again. Your CloudQuery sync will now be run on a regular schedule.

## Next steps

This tutorial was just a quick introduction to help you get started with a CloudQuery deployment on Kestra. You can now create additional Kestra tasks to perform transformations, send notifications and more. For more information, check out the [CloudQuery docs](/docs) and the [Kestra docs](https://kestra.io/docs/). To productionize your Kestra deployment, you will likely need to deploy it to a cloud container environment, such as Kubernetes. For more information, see the [Kestra Deployment with Kubernetes guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/kubernetes).
