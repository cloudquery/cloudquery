# Scheduling CloudQuery Syncs with Google Cloud Run and Cloud Scheduler

[Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that can be invoked via web requests or Pub/Sub events. It provides a serverless experience for developers to deploy and run highly scalable applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. While not a perfect fit for CloudQuery syncs, it provides a relatively simple way to run CloudQuery as a serverless container on Google Cloud. If your use case is more complex but still requires deployment on GCP, you may want to consider deploying to a [Virtual Machine](/docs/deployment/google-cloud-vm), [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/overview) or [Google Data Flow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) instead.

Note that [Cloud Run quotas](https://cloud.google.com/run/quotas) impose a 1 hour time limit per execution (i.e. CloudQuery sync)

## Deploying with Cloud Run

See the [cloudquery/cloudrun-example](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudrun-example) repository for an example Docker file and instructions on how to deploy CloudQuery using Cloud Run and Cloud Scheduler. Cloud Run containers must accept incoming connections on a given port (8080 by default). The Docker image above wraps CloudQuery with a small web server that listens for incoming requests and starts a sync whenever a request is received. You should keep the HTTP endpoint private, making it available only to the Cloud Scheduler that triggers the sync on a schedule.
