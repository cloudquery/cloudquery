# Overview

CloudQuery can run locally, but if you want to deploy in a remote non-ephemeral environment to sync periodically and store the data in a managed PostgreSQL, the recommended way is to deploy on Kubernetes (EKS or GKE) with our [helm-charts](https://github.com/cloudquery/helm-charts).

We have also written some guides to help you get started on different platforms.
