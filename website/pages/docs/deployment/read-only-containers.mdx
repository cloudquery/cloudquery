# Containers with Read-Only Root Filesystem

By default, CloudQuery requires a read-write file system to create a socket file used by the integrations to communicate with the CLI. It is however not possible to create a read-write socket on a read-only file system. For this to work, an integration needs to be started as a gRPC server locally.

## Creating a container that works with a read-only file system

To create a container that works with a read-only file system, you will need the following:

- a CloudQuery configuration file that is used to install the required integrations
- a CloudQuery configuration file that contains the specs needed for the sync
- a start script used as an entry point for the container that will start the integrations and run the sync

> Downloading integrations requires users to be authenticated, normally this means running `cloudquery login` but that is not doable in a CI environment or inside of a docker build process. The recommended way to handle this is to use an API key. More information on generating an API Key can be found [here](/docs/deployment/generate-api-key)

In the example below, we will use the [XKCD](https://github.com/hermanschaaf/cq-source-xkcd) source integration and [PostgreSQL](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/destination/cloudquery/postgresql/v6.1.3/docs) destination integration.

### Create a configuration file for the installation

This configuration file should reference the integrations that you want to install with the actual source where they should be downloaded from:

```yaml copy filename="install.yaml"
kind: source
spec:
  name: xkcd
  path: hermanschaaf/xkcd
  version: v2.0.0
  registry: github
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
  tables: ["*"]
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "postgresql"
  path: "cloudquery/postgresql"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_POSTGRESQL"
```

### Create a config file for the sync

This config file should reference the integrations running as gRPC servers (fill in the `connection_string`). We will run XKCD on port 7778 and PostgreSQL on port 7779:

```yaml copy filename="sync.yaml"
kind: source
spec:
  name: xkcd
  registry: grpc
  path: localhost:7778
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
  tables: ["*"]
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "postgresql"
  registry: grpc
  path: localhost:7779
  spec:
    connection_string: "[REDACTED]"
```

### Create a start script to start the integrations

This shell script will start the integrations and the sync with the provided parameters when we run the container. To make it easier to maintain, we will use the `find` command to get the path to the actual integration binary. This way, we don't have to worry about the version of the integration.

```shell copy filename="start.sh"
#!/bin/sh
# get path to the xkcd integration:
xkcd_plugin_path=$(find .cq -regex ".*/xkcd/.*/plugin")
# get path to the postgresql integration:
postgresql_plugin_path=$(find .cq -regex ".*/postgresql/.*/plugin")

# start the integrations and run the sync with the provided parameters:
sh -c "${xkcd_plugin_path} serve --address localhost:7778" & \
sh -c "${postgresql_plugin_path} serve --address localhost:7779" & \
/app/cloudquery $@
```

### Connecting it all together

We will use the `ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest` container as a base and add all the files in it. Then we will override the entry point with our start script:

```docker
FROM ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest as build
WORKDIR /app
# this is the install.yaml file we created above
COPY ./install.yaml /app/install.yaml
ARG CLOUDQUERY_API_KEY
# install the integrations
RUN /app/cloudquery plugin install install.yaml

FROM ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the .cq directory which contains the integrations
COPY --from=build /app/.cq /app/.cq

# add the sync config file
COPY ./sync.yaml /app/sync.yaml
# add the start script
COPY --chmod=0755 ./start.sh /app/start.sh
# override the start script
ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/start.sh"]
```

## Run the Container

First, build the container as you would normally do:

```bash
docker build --build-arg CLOUDQUERY_API_KEY=<your-api-key> ./ -t my-cq-container:latest
```

Run the container with `--read-only` option and a command to pass to our start script. You will also need to add the `--no-log-file` option to skip logging to a file. Here is an example:

```bash copy
docker run --read-only --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway my-cq-container:latest --no-log-file sync sync.yaml
```
