# Quickstart

Follow the steps below to start syncing data from CloudQuery supported source plugins to one or more destination plugins.

## Download CloudQuery CLI

<DownloadSection/>

## Configure Destination Plugin

Destination plugins defines where you will be syncing you data to (You can find list of available destinations [here](./plugins/destinations)).

For example, let's configure the [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/cli/internal/destinations/postgresql) destination plugin.

```yaml
kind: destination
spec:
  ## Required. name of the plugin
  name: "postgresql"

  ## Optional. Default: "latest". We suggest pinning this to a specific version in production
  # verison: "YOUR_VERSION"

  ## Optional. Default: "overwrite". Available: "overwrite", "append". Not all modes are supported by all plugins
  ## make sure to check the plugin documentation for more details.
  write_mode: "overwrite" # overwrite, append

  spec:
    ## plugin specific configuration
    ## For postgreSQL:
    ## Required. Connection string to your PostgreSQL instance
    connection_string: "postgresql://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
```

## Configure Source Plugin

Source plugins defines the plugins and APIs you want to sync from (You can find list of available sources [here](./plugins/sources)).

For example, let's configure [AWS](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/aws) source plugin.

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  ## Required. name of the plugin to use
  name: "aws" # required

  ## Optional. Default: "github". Available: "local", "grpc"
  # registry: github

  ## Optional. Default: name or cloudquery/name
  # path: cloudquery/aws

  # Optional. Default: latest. We suggest to pin this in production
  # verison: "YOUR_VERSION"

  ## Optional. Default: ["*"] - all tables. We recommend to specify specific tables that you need to sync as this
  ## will reduce the amount of data synced and improve performance.
  # tables: ["*"]

  ## Required. all destinations you want to sync data to.
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  spec:
    # plugin specific configuration
```

## Start Syncing

Now you can start syncing the data from your source plugins to the specified destinations.

You can sync the by specifing a directory with the configuration files or specify files directly

```bash
cloudquery sync ./config_dir

# or cloudquery sync aws.yml postgresql.yml
```

You should see a spinner with number of resources synced and the time it took to sync.
Once the sync is done you can query the data via the database directly.

Note: All logs are written by default to `cloudquery.log` so you can easily see if any APIs failed.
