# Policies

CloudQuery uses standard SQL to create security,compliance and cost policies that you can then visualize and monitor with your current BI stack such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), [QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/), [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/), etcâ€¦

We provide out of the box SQL policies and dashboards for asset inventories and CSPMs (Cloud Security Posture Management) with popular frameworks such as CIS, HIPPA, PCI-DSS and more.
