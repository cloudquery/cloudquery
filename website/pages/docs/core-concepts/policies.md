# Policies

CloudQuery maintains a few official SQL policies, and dashboards for security, compliance and cost that you can visualize and monitor with your current BI stack such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), [QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/), [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/), etcâ€¦

Policies, views, and dashboard include asset inventories and CSPMs (Cloud Security Posture Management) with popular frameworks such as CIS, HIPPA, PCI-DSS and more.
