# Policies

CloudQuery maintains official SQL policies and dashboards for security, compliance and cost that you can visualize and monitor with your current BI stack such as [Grafana](/how-to-guides/open-source-cspm), [Apache Superset](/how-to-guides/cloud-asset-inventory-cloudquery-apache-superset), [QuickSight](/how-to-guides/cloud-asset-inventory-cloudquery-aws-quicksight), [PowerBI](/how-to-guides/cloud-asset-inventory-cloudquery-microsoft-power-bi), etc…

Policies, views, and dashboards include asset inventories and CSPMs (Cloud Security Posture Management tools) with popular frameworks such as CIS, HIPPA, PCI-DSS and more.
