# Overview

Fetch command is the core command for CloudQuery. It extracts the configuration of your cloud assets, transforms them and loads them into a single PostgreSQL database.

## Running

### Spawn or connection to PostgreSQL database

CloudQuery needs a PostgreSQL database (>=10). You can either spawn a local one (usually good for development and local testing)
or connect to an existing one.

For local, you can use the following docker command:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -d postgres
```

### Generate `cloudquery.yml`

An initial `cloudquery.yml` can be generated via `cloudquery init [provider]` (`provider` can be `aws`, `gcp` - see all options at <https://hub.cloudquery.io>).

If you are using an existing database, you will have to update the `connection` section
in `cloudquery.yml`:

```yml
cloudquery:
    providers:
        - name: aws
          version: latest
    connection:
        type: postgres
        username: postgres
        password: pass
        host: localhost
        port: 5432
        database: postgres
        sslmode: disable
```

### Fetch

Once `cloudquery.yml` is generated, run the following command to fetch the resources. \(You need to be authenticated â€” see relevant section under each provider\):

```text
cloudquery fetch
# cloudquery fetch --help # Show all possible fetch flags
```
