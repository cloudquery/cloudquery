# Getting Started with AWS

<DownloadSection />

## Running

### Init command

After installing CloudQuery, you need to generate a `cloudquery.yml` file that will describe which cloud provider you want to use and which resources you want CloudQuery to ETL:

```bash
cloudquery init aws

# cloudquery init aws gcp # This will generate a config containing aws and gcp providers
# cloudquery init --help # Show all possible auto generated configs and flags
```

All official and approved community providers are listed at [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io) with their respective documentation.

### Authenticate with AWS

CloudQuery needs to be authenticated with your AWS account in order to `fetch` information about your cloud setup.

:::info
CloudQuery requires only *read* permissions (we will never make any changes to your cloud setup). 
Attaching the `ReadOnlyAccess` policy to the user/role CloudQuery is running as should work for the most part, 
but you can fine-tune it even more to have read-only access for the specific set of resources that you want 
CloudQuery to fetch. 
[See also this blog post](https://alestic.com/2015/10/aws-iam-readonly-too-permissive/).
:::

There are multiple ways to authenticate with AWS, and CloudQuery respects the AWS credential provider chain.
This means that CloudQuery will follow the following priorities when attempting to authenticate:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables.
- `credentials` and `config` files in `~/.aws` folder (in this respective priority).
- IAM roles for AWS compute resources (including EC2 instances, fargate and ECS containers).

You can find more info about AWS authentication 
[here](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/creds-config-files.html)

    {label: 'IAM roles for AWS compute resources', value: 'iam_roles'}
  ]}>

<Tab value='environment_variables'>

CloudQuery can use the credentials from the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and
`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables (`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` can be optional for some accounts). For information about obtaining credentials, see the 
[AWS guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/getting-started/#get-your-aws-access-keys).

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Tab>

<Tab value='shared_configuration_files'>

CloudQuery can use credentials from your `credentials` and `config` files in the `.aws` directory in your home folder. 
The contents of these files are practically interchangeable, but CloudQuery will prioritize credentials in the `credentials` file.

For information about obtaining credentials, see the 
[AWS guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/getting-started/#get-your-aws-access-keys). 

Here are example contents for a `credentials` file:

```toml title="~/.aws/credentials"
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

You can also specify credentials for a different profile, and instruct cloudquery to use the credentials from this profile instead of the default one.

For example:

```toml title="~/.aws/credentials"
[myprofile]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

Then, you can either export the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
```

or, configure your desired profile in the `local_profile` field of your CloudQuery `cloudquery.yml`:

```yaml title="cloudquery.yml"
providers:
  - name: "aws"
    configuration:
      accounts:
        - name: "<YOUR_ID>"
          local_profile: "myprofile"
    ...
  ...
```

</Tab>

<Tab value='iam_roles'>

Cloudquery can use IAM roles for AWS compute resources (including EC2 instances, fargate and ECS containers).
If you configured your AWS compute resources with IAM, cloudquery will use these roles automatically! You don't need to specify additional 
credentials manually. For more information on configuring IAM, see the AWS docs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html).

#### Multi Account/Organization Access
 
If you have multiple AWS accounts/organizations, you can follow the steps set in the [cq-provider-aws README](https://hub.cloudquery.io/providers/cloudquery/aws/latest#multi-account-configuration-aws-organizations).

### Fetch Command

Once `cloudquery.yml` is generated and you are authenticated with AWS, run the following command to fetch the resources.

```bash
cloudquery fetch
# cloudquery fetch --help # Show all possible fetch flags
```

### Exploring and Running Queries

<ExploreSection/>

Schema and tables for AWS are available in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/providers/cloudquery/aws/latest/schema).

A few example queries for AWS:

#### List ec2\_images:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_ec2_images;
```

#### Find all public-facing AWS load balancers:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_elbv2_load_balancers WHERE scheme = 'internet-facing';
```

### Policy Command

CloudQuery Policies allow users to write security, governance, cost, and compliance rules, 
using SQL as the query layer and HCL as the logical layer.

All official and approved community policies are listed on [Github](https://github.com/cloudquery/cq-provider-aws/tree/main/policies).

#### Execute a policy

```bash
cloudquery policy run aws//cis_v1.2.0
```
