# Source Spec Reference

Following are available options for the top level source plugin `spec` object.

Note: For configuring individual plugins, please refer to the configuration section from the relevant plugins from [here](/docs/plugins/sources/overview). (e.g. [AWS plugin configuration](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/configuration)).

## Example

This example configures the AWS plugin, and connects is to a `postgresql` destination:

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: "aws"
  path: "cloudquery/aws"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  spec:
```

## Spec

### name

(`string`, required)

Name of the plugin. If you have multiple source plugins, this must be unique. 

The name field may be used to uniquely identify a particular source configuration. For example, if you have two configs for the AWS plugin for syncing different accounts, one may be named `aws-account-1` and the other `aws-account-2`. In this case, the `path` option below must be used to specify the download path for the plugin.

### registry

(`string`, optional, default: `github`, available: `github`, `local`, `grpc`)

- `github`: CloudQuery will look for and download the plugin from GitHub, and then execute it.
- `local`: CloudQuery will execute the plugin from a local path. 
- `grpc`: mostly useful in debug mode when plugin is already running in a different terminal, CloudQuery will connect to the gRPC plugin server directly without spawning the process.

### path

(`string`, required)

Configures how to retrieve the plugin. The contents depend on the value of `registry` (`github` by default).

- For plugins hosted on GitHub, `path` should be of the form `"<org>/<repository>"`. For official plugins, should be `cloudquery/<plugin-name>`.
- For plugins that are located in the local filesystem, `path` should a filesystem path to the plugin binary.
- To connect to a running plugin via `grpc` (mostly useful for debugging), `path` should be the host-port of the plugin (e.g. `localhost:7777`).

### version

(`string`, required)

`version` must be a valid [SemVer](https://semver.org/)), e.g. `vMajor.Minor.Patch`. You can find all official plugin versions under [cloudquery/cloudquery/releases](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases), and for community plugins you can find it in the relevant community repository.

### tables

(`[]string`, optional, default: `["*"]`)

Tables to sync from the source plugin. It accepts wildcards. For example, to match all EC2-related tables, : `aws_ec2_*`. Matched tables will also sync all their descendant tables, unless these are skipped in `skip_tables`.

### skip_tables

(`[]string`, optional, default: `[]`)

Useful when using wildcards in `tables`. Specify which tables to skip when syncing the source plugin. Note that if a table with dependencies is skipped, all its dependant tables will also be skipped.

### destinations

(`[]string`, required)

Specify the names of the destinations to sync the data of the source plugin to.

### concurrency

(`int`, optional, default: `1000000`, introduced in CLI `v1.4.1`)

A best effort maximum number of Go routines to use. Lower this number to reduce memory usage.

### spec

(`object`, optional)

Plugin specific configurations. Visit [source plugins](/docs/plugins/sources/overview) documentation for more information.
