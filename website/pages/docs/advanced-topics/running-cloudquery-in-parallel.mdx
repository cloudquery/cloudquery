# Running CloudQuery in Parallel

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Running multiple instances of `cloudquery sync` in parallel can be useful when fetching from a large number of accounts,
or when fetching from large accounts. This page provides important guidelines for this use case.

All guidelines in this page also apply when running a single cloudquery instance with multiple source-plugins.

## Unique Names

Every source and destination plugin configuration must have a unique `name`. This is required because the `name` is
written into the database (`_cq_source_name`), and is used to later delete stale resources.

For instance, a configuration with multiple source plugins could look like:

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws1
  path: cloudquery/aws
  ...
---
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws2
  path: cloudquery/aws
  ...
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "postgresql"
  path: cloudquery/postgresql
  ...
```

If the names are not unique, then the different plugins may delete/overwrite each other's resources.

## No Overlapping Syncs

When splitting a sync into multiple source-plugin configurations to be run in parallel, it is important
that these syncs don't overlap - the set of Account/Table/Region that every source-plugin grabs must not intersect.

For instance, in GCP, if the first source-plugin fetches resource `A` from project `1`, the second source-plugin
can fetch resource `B` from project `1`, or resource `A` from project `2`, but can never fetch resource `A` from project `1`.

For another example, if the first source-plugin fetches from region `europe-west1` in project `1`, the second source-plugin
can fetch from region `europe-west1` in project `2`, or from region `europe-west2` in project `1`, but can never fetch from
region `europe-west1` in project `1`.

If the configurations overlap, the behavior is unexpected, and the database may contain duplicate rows.
