## ClickHouse spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the ClickHouse destination plugin.

- `connection_string` (string, required)

  Connection string to connect to the database.
  See [SDK documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more details.

- `ca_cert` (string, optional. Default: not used)

  If you need to use a custom CA to connect to ClickHouse instance you can use `ca_cert` option.
  The following values are supported:

  - Path to cert file
  - CA cert data in plain text (or substituted from environment variable)

### Example

This example configures a ClickHouse instance, located at `localhost:9000`.
The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name:     "clickhouse"
  registry: "github"
  path:     "cloudquery/clickhouse"
  version:  "VERSION_DESTINATION_CLICKHOUSE"

  spec:
    connection_string: "clickhouse://${CH_USER}:${CH_PASSWORD}@localhost:9000/${CH_DATABASE}"
```

### Verbose logging for debug

The ClickHouse destination can be run in debug mode.
To achieve this pass the `debug=true` option to `connection_string`.
See [SDK documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more details.

Note: This will use [SDK](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go) built-in logging
and might output data and sensitive information to logs.
Make sure not to use it in production environment.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name:     "clickhouse"
  registry: "github"
  path:     "cloudquery/clickhouse"
  version:  "VERSION_DESTINATION_CLICKHOUSE"

  spec:
    connection_string: "clickhouse://${CH_USER}:${CH_PASSWORD}@localhost:9000/${CH_DATABASE}?debug=true"
```
