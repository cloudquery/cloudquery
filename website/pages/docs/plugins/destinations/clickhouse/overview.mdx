This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) database.

Supported database versions: >= `22.1.2`

## Configuration

### Example

<Configuration/>

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you use environment variable expansion in production instead of committing the credentials to the configuration file directly.
</Callout>

### ClickHouse spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the ClickHouse destination plugin.

- `connection_string` (string, required)

  Connection string to connect to the database.
  See [SDK documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more details.

- `cluster` (string, optional. Default: not used)

  Cluster name to be used for [distributed DDL](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/distributed-ddl).
  If the value is empty, DDL operations will affect only the server the plugin is connected to.

- `ca_cert` (string, optional. Default: not used)

  If you need to use a custom CA to connect to ClickHouse instance you can use `ca_cert` option.
  The following values are supported:

  - Path to cert file
  - CA cert data in plain text (or substituted from environment variable)

- `engine` (optional, structure documented [below](#clickhouse-table-engine). Default: `MergeTree` engine)

  Engine to be used for tables.
  Only [`*MergeTree` family](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/) is supported at the moment.

#### ClickHouse table engine

This option allows to specify a custom table engine to be used.

- `name` (string, required)

  Name of the table engine.
  Only [`*MergeTree` family](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/) is supported at the moment.

- `parameters` (array of parameters, optional. Default: empty)

  Engine parameters.
  Parameters can be strings, numbers, booleans.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name:     "clickhouse"
  registry: "github"
  path:     "cloudquery/clickhouse"
  version:  "VERSION_DESTINATION_CLICKHOUSE"

  spec:
    connection_string: "clickhouse://${CH_USER}:${CH_PASSWORD}@localhost:9000/${CH_DATABASE}"
    engine:
      name: ReplicatedMergeTree
      parameters:
      - "/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/{database}/{table}"
      - "{replica}"
```


#### Verbose logging for debug

The ClickHouse destination can be run in debug mode.
To achieve this pass the `debug=true` option to `connection_string`.
See [SDK documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more details.

Note: This will use [SDK](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go) built-in logging
and might output data and sensitive information to logs.
Make sure not to use it in production environment.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name:     "clickhouse"
  registry: "github"
  path:     "cloudquery/clickhouse"
  version:  "VERSION_DESTINATION_CLICKHOUSE"

  spec:
    connection_string: "clickhouse://${CH_USER}:${CH_PASSWORD}@localhost:9000/${CH_DATABASE}?debug=true"
```
