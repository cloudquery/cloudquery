This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) database.

Supported database versions: >= `22.1.2`

## Configuration

### Example

<Configuration/>

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you use environment variable expansion in production instead of committing the credentials to the configuration file directly.
</Callout>

### ClickHouse spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the ClickHouse destination plugin.

- `connection_string` (string, required)

  Connection string to connect to the database.
  See [SDK documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more details.

- `cluster` (string, optional. Default: not used)
  Cluster name to be used for [distributed DDL](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/distributed-ddl).
  If the value is empty, DDL operations will affect only the server the plugin is connected to.

- `ca_cert` (string, optional. Default: not used)

  If you need to use a custom CA to connect to ClickHouse instance you can use `ca_cert` option.
  The following values are supported:

  - Path to cert file
  - CA cert data in plain text (or substituted from environment variable)

#### Verbose logging for debug

The ClickHouse destination can be run in debug mode.
To achieve this pass the `debug=true` option to `connection_string`.
See [SDK documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more details.

Note: This will use [SDK](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go) built-in logging
and might output data and sensitive information to logs.
Make sure not to use it in production environment.
