This example configures the file destination, to create CSV files in  `./cq_csv_output`. You can also choose `json` or `parquet` as the output format. Note that the file plugin only supports `append` write-mode.

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "file"
  path: "cloudquery/file"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_FILE"
  write_mode: "append" # file only supports 'append' mode

  spec:
    directory: "./cq_csv_output"
    format: "csv" # supported values are 'csv', 'json' and 'parquet'
```
