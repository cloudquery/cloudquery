This example configures the file destination, to create CSV files in  `./cq_csv_output`. You can also choose `json` or `parquet` as the output format.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "file"
  path: "cloudquery/file"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_FILE"
  spec:
    path: "path/to/files/{{TABLE}}/{{UUID}}.{{FORMAT}}"
#    batch_size: 10000 # optional
#    batch_size_bytes: 52428800 # optional
#    batch_timeout: 30s # optional
    format: "csv" # options: parquet, json, csv
    format_spec:
      delimiter: ","
```

Note that the file plugin only supports `append` write-mode. The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).
