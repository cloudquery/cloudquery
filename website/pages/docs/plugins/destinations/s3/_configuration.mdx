This example uses the parquet format, to create parquet files in `s3://bucket_name/path/to/files`, with each table placed in its own directory.

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "s3"
  path: "cloudquery/s3"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_S3"
  write_mode: "append" # s3 only supports 'append' mode
  # batch_size: 10000 # optional
  # batch_size_bytes: 5242880 # optional
  spec:
    bucket: "bucket_name"
    path: "path/to/files/{{TABLE}}/{{UUID}}.parquet"
    format: "parquet"
    athena: false # <- set this to true for Athena compatibility
```

It is also possible to use `{{YEAR}}`, `{{MONTH}}`, `{{DAY}}` and `{{HOUR}}` in the path to create a directory structure based on the current time. For example:

```
path: "path/to/files/{{TABLE}}/dt={{YEAR}}-{{MONTH}}-{{DAY}}/{{UUID}}.parquet"
```

Other supported formats are `json` and `csv`.
