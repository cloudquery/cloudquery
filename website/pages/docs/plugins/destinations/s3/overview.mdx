This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to remote S3 storage in various formats such as CSV, JSON and Parquet.

This is useful in various use-cases, especially in data lakes where you can query the data direct from Athena or load it to various data warehouses such as BigQuery, RedShift, Snowflake and others.

## Example

<Configuration />

The S3 destination utilizes batching, and supports `batch_size`, `batch_size_bytes` and `batch_timeout` options (see below).

## S3 Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the CSV destination Plugin.

- `bucket` (string) (required)

  Bucket where to sync the files.

- `region` (string) (required)

  Region where bucket is located.

- `path` (string) (required)

  Path to where the files will be uploaded in the above bucket. The path supports the following placeholder variables:

  - `{{TABLE}}` will be replaced with the table name
  - `{{FORMAT}}` will be replaced with the file format, such as `csv`, `json` or `parquet`
  - `{{UUID}}` will be replaced with a random UUID to uniquely identify each file
  - `{{YEAR}}` will be replaced with the current year in `YYYY` format
  - `{{MONTH}}` will be replaced with the current month in `MM` format
  - `{{DAY}}` will be replaced with the current day in `DD` format
  - `{{HOUR}}` will be replaced with the current hour in `HH` format
  - `{{MINUTE}}` will be replaced with the current minute in `mm` format

  Note that timestamps are in UTC and will be the current time at the time the file is written, not when the sync started.

- `athena` (boolean) (optional, default `false`)

  When `athena` is set to `true`, the S3 plugin will sanitize keys in JSON columns to be compatible with the Hive Metastore / Athena. This allows tables to be created with a Glue Crawler and then queried via Athena, without changes to the table schema.

- `test_write` (boolean) (optional, default `true`)

  Ensure write access to the given bucket and path by writing a test object on each sync. If you are sure that the bucket and path are writable, you can set this to `false` to skip the test.

- `endpoint` (string) (optional, default empty)

  Endpoint to use for S3 API calls. This is useful for S3-compatible storage services such as MinIO.

- `format` (string) (required)

  Format of the output file. Supported values are `csv`, `json` and `parquet`.

- `format_spec` (map [format_spec](#format_spec)) (optional)
  Optional parameters to change the format of the file

- `batch_size` (integer, optional. default: 10000)

  Number of records to write before starting a new object.

- `batch_size_bytes` (integer, optional. default: 52428800 (50 MiB))

  Number of bytes (as Arrow buffer size) to write before starting a new object.

- `batch_timeout` (duration, optional. default: 30s (30 seconds))

  Inactivity time before starting a new object.

## format_spec

- `delimiter` (string) (optional) (default: `,`)

  Character that will be used as want to use as the delimiter if the format type is `csv`

- `skip_header` (bool) (optional) (default: false)

  Specifies if the first line of a file should be the headers (when format is `csv`).
