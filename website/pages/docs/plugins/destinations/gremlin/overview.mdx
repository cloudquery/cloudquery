This destination plugin lets you sync data from any CloudQuery source to a Gremlin compatible graph database such as AWS Neptune or Azure CosmosDB.

Supported database (tested) versions (We use the [official Go driver](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-go)):

- Gremlin Server >= 3.6.2
- AWS Neptune >= 1.2

As a side note graph databases can be quite useful for various networking use-cases, visualization, for read-teams, blue-teams and more.

## Configuration

### Example

<Configuration />

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you use environment variable expansion in production instead of committing the credentials to the configuration file directly.
</Callout>

The Gremlin destination utilizes batching, and supports [`batch_size`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size) and [`batch_size_bytes`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size_bytes).

### Plugin Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the Gremlin destination Plugin.

- `endpoint` (string, required)

  Endpoint for the database. Supported schemes are `wss://` and `ws://`, the default port is `8182`.

  - `"localhost"` (defaults to `wss://localhost:8182`)
  - `"ws://localhost:8182"`
  - `"wss://your-endpoint.cluster-id.your-region.neptune.amazonaws.com"`

- `insecure` (boolean, optional)

  Whether to skip TLS verification. Defaults to `false`. This should be set on a MacOS environment when connecting to an AWS Neptune endpoint.

- `auth_mode` (either `none`, `basic` or `aws`, default: `none`)

  Authentication mode to use. `basic` uses static credentials, `aws` uses AWS IAM authentication.

- `username` (string, optional)

  Username to connect to the database, for static authentication.

- `password` (string, optional)

  Password to connect to the database, for static authentication.
