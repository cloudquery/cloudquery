This example sets the connection string to a value read from the `SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable:

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: snowflake
  path: cloudquery/snowflake
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_SNOWFLAKE"
  write_mode: "append"
  # batch_size: 10000 # optional
  # batch_size_bytes: 5242880 # optional
  spec:
    connection_string: ${SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTION_STRING}
```
