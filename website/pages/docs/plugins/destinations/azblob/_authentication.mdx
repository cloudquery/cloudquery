The plugin needs to be authenticated with your Azure account in order to fetch information about your cloud setup.

You can either authenticate with `az login` (when running locally), or by using a "service principal" and exporting environment variables (appropriate for automated deployments).

You can find out more about authentication with Azure at Azure's [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go) for the Go SDK.
