This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to remote Azure Blob Storage storage in various formats such as CSV, JSON and Parquet.

## Example

This example configures an Azure blob storage destination, to create CSV files in `https://cqdestinationazblob.blob.core.windows.net/test/path/to/files`.

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "azblob"
  path: "cloudquery/azblob"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_AZBLOB"
  spec:
    storage_account: "cqdestinationazblob"
    container: "test"
    path: "path/to/files"
#    batch_size: 10000 # optional
#    batch_size_bytes: 52428800 # optional
#    batch_timeout: 30s # optional
    format: "csv"
    format_spec:
      delimiter: ","
```

The Azure Blob destination utilizes batching, and supports `batch_size`, `batch_size_bytes` and `batch_timeout` options (see below).

  Number of records to write before starting a new object.

- `batch_size_bytes` (integer, optional. default: 52428800 (50 MiB))

  Number of bytes (as Arrow buffer size) to write before starting a new object.

- `batch_timeout` (duration, optional. default: 30s (30 seconds))

  Inactivity time before starting a new object.

## format_spec
