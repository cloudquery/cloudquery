This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to remote Azure Blob Storage storage in various formats such as CSV, JSON and Parquet.

## Example

This example configures an Azure blob storage destination, to create CSV files in `https://cqdestinationazblob.blob.core.windows.net/test/path/to/files`. Note that the Azure blob storage plugin only supports `append` write-mode.

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "azblob"
  path: "cloudquery/azblob"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_AZBLOB"
  write_mode: "append" # this plugin only supports 'append' mode
  # batch_size: 10000 # optional
  # batch_size_bytes: 5242880 # optional
  spec:
    storage_account: "cqdestinationazblob"
    container: "test"
    path: "path/to/files"
    format: "csv"
    format_spec:
      delimiter: ","
```

The Azure blob destination utilizes batching, and supports [`batch_size`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size) and [`batch_size_bytes`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size_bytes).
