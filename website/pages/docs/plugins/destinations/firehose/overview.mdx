The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

The Amazon Kinesis Firehose destination utilizes batching, and supports [`batch_size`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size) and [`batch_size_bytes`](/docs/reference/destination-spec#batch_size_bytes). 

It is important to note that Amazon Kinesis Firehose has the following limitations that cannot be changed:
  - The maximum size of a record sent to Kinesis Data Firehose, before base64-encoding, is 1,000 KiB.
  - The `PutRecordBatch` operation can take up to 500 records per batch or 4 MiB per batch, whichever is smaller.

## Firehose Spec

- `stream_arn` (string) (required)

  Kinesis Firehose delivery stream where data will be sent.
