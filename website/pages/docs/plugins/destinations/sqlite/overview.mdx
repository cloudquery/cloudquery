This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to a SQLite database. This can be useful for local data exploration as no other database or service is required.

## Example Config

This is a basic configuration that will save all your sync resources to `db.sql`.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: sqlite
  path: cloudquery/sqlite
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_SQLITE"
  spec:
    connection_string: ./db.sql
```

After running `cloudquery sync`, you can explore the data locally with the SQLite CLI: `sqlite ./db.sql`.

## SQLite Spec

This is the top level spec used by the SQLite destination Plugin.

- `connection_string` (string) (required)

  path to a file. such as `./mydb.sql`
