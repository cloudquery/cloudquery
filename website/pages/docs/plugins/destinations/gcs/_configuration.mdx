This example configures a GCS destination, to create CSV files in `gcs://bucket_name/path/to/files`.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "gcs"
  path: "cloudquery/gcs"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_GCS"
  write_mode: "append" # gcs only supports 'append' mode
  # batch_size: 10000 # optional
  # batch_size_bytes: 5242880 # optional
  spec:
    bucket: "bucket_name"
    path: "path/to/files"
    format: "csv"
    format_spec:
      delimiter: ","
```

Note that the GCS plugin only supports `append` write-mode. The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).
