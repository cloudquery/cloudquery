This destination plugin lets you sync data from a CloudQuery source to remote GCS (Google Cloud Storage) storage in various formats such as CSV, JSON and Parquet.

This is useful in various use-cases, especially in data lakes where you can query the data direct from Athena or load it to various data warehouses such as BigQuery, RedShift, Snowflake and others.

## Example
