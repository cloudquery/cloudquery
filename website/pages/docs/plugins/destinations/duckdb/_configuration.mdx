This is a basic configuration that will save all your sync resources to `/path/to/example.db`.

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: duckdb
  path: cloudquery/duckdb
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_DUCKDB"
  spec:
    connection_string: /path/to/example.db
```

After running `cloudquery sync`, you can explore the data locally with the DuckDB CLI: `duckdb /path/to/example.db`.
