This example configures connects to a Kafka destination with no authentication and pushes messages in JSON format. Note that the plugin only supports `append` write-mode.

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "kafka"
  path: "cloudquery/kafka"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_KAFKA"
  write_mode: "append" # only supports 'append'

  spec:
    brokers: ["<broker-host>:<broker-port>"]
    format: "json"
```
