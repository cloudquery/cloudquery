This example configures connects to a Kafka destination with no authentication and pushes messages in JSON format.

The (top level) spec section is described in the [Destination Spec Reference](/docs/reference/destination-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: destination
spec:
  name: "kafka"
  path: "cloudquery/kafka"
  version: "VERSION_DESTINATION_KAFKA"
  spec:
    brokers: ["<broker-host>:<broker-port>"]
    format: "csv" # options: parquet, json, csv
    format_spec:
      # CSV-specific parameters:
      # delimiter: ","
      # skip_header: false

    # Optional parameters
    # compression: "" # options: gzip
    # sasl_username: ""
    # sasl_password: ""
    # client_id: cq-destination-kafka
    # verbose: false
    # batch_size: 1000
```
