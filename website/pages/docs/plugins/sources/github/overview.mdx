The CloudQuery GitHub plugin extracts your GitHub API and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

## GitHub Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by GitHub Source Plugin

- `repos` (`[]string`, optional. Default: empty):
  List of repositories to sync from. The format is `owner/repo` (e.g. `cloudquery/cloudquery`). You must specify either `orgs` or `repos` in the configuration.

- `orgs` (`[]string`, optional. Default: empty):
  List of organizations to sync from. You must specify either `orgs` or `repos` in the configuration.

- `concurrency` (int, optional, default: 10000):
  A best effort maximum number of Go routines to use. Lower this number to reduce memory usage.

- `discovery_concurrency` (`int`) (default: `1`)

  During initialization the GitHub source plugin discovers all repositories under the organizations configured in `orgs`, to be used later on during the sync process.
  By default the plugin discovers repositories one organization at a time. You can increase `discovery_concurrency` to discover multiple organizations in parallel, or use a negative value to discover all organizations in parallel.
  Please note that it's possible to hit GitHub API rate limits when using a high value for `discovery_concurrency`.
