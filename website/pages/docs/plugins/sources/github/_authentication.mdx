CloudQuery requires only a Personal Access Token. Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on how to create a personal access token for CloudQuery.

CloudQuery requires only *read* permissions (we will never make any changes to your GitHub account or organizations),
so, following the principle of least privilege, it's recommended to grant it read-only permissions.
