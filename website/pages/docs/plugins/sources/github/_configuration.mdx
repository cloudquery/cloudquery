To configure CloudQuery to extract from GitHub, create a `.yml` file in your CloudQuery configuration directory.
The following configuration will extract information from the `cloudquery` organization, and connect it to a `DESTINATION_NAME` destination plugin

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: github
  path: cloudquery/github
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_GITHUB"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["DESTINATION_NAME"]
  spec:
    access_token: <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE> # Required. Personal Access Token
    orgs: ["cloudquery"] # Required. List of organizations to extract from
```

It is recommended that you use environment variable expansion for the access token in production. For example, if the access token is stored in an environment variable called `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`:

```yaml copy
spec:
  access_token: ${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```
