To configure CloudQuery to extract from GitHub, create a `.yml` file in your CloudQuery configuration directory.
The following configuration will extract information from the `cloudquery/cloudquery` repository:

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: github
  path: cloudquery/github
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_GITHUB"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["DESTINATION_NAME"]
  spec:
    access_token: <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE> # Personal Access Token, required if not using App Authentication.
    ## App Authentication (one per org):
    # app_auth:
    # - org: cloudquery
    #   private_key_path: <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY> # Path to private key file
    #   app_id: <YOUR_APP_ID> # App ID, required for App Authentication.
    #   installation_id: <ORG_INSTALLATION_ID> # Installation ID for this org
    orgs: [] # Optional. List of organizations to extract from
    repos: ["cloudquery/cloudquery"] # Optional. List of repositories to extract from
```

You must specify either `orgs` or `repos` in the configuration. If a repository is specified in both `orgs` and `repos`, it will be extracted only once, and other repositories from that organization will be ignored.

It is recommended that you use environment variable expansion for the access token in production. For example, if the access token is stored in an environment variable called `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`:

```yaml copy
spec:
  access_token: ${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```
