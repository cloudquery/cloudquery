To configure CloudQuery to extract from GitHub, create a `.yml` file in your CloudQuery configuration directory.
The following configuration will extract information from the `cloudquery/cloudquery` repository:

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: github
  path: cloudquery/github
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_GITHUB"
  # adjust this value up or down to change the number of tables that are resolved in parallel
  concurrency: 10000
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["DESTINATION_NAME"]
  spec:
    access_token: <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE> # Personal Access Token, required if not using App Authentication.
    ## App Authentication (one per org):
    # app_auth:
    # - org: cloudquery
    #   private_key_path: <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY> # Path to private key file
    #   app_id: <YOUR_APP_ID> # App ID, required for App Authentication.
    #   installation_id: <ORG_INSTALLATION_ID> # Installation ID for this org
    orgs: [] # Optional. List of organizations to extract from
    repos: ["cloudquery/cloudquery"] # Optional. List of repositories to extract from
    ## GitHub Enterprise
    # In order to enable GHE you have to provide two urls, the base url of the server and the upload url.
    # Quote from GitHub's client:
    #   If the base URL does not have the suffix "/api/v3/", it will be added automatically. If the upload URL does not have the suffix "/api/uploads", it will be added automatically.
    #   Another important thing is that by default, the GitHub Enterprise URL format should be http(s)://[hostname]/api/v3/ or you will always receive the 406 status code. The upload URL format should be http(s)://[hostname]/api/uploads/"
    # If you are not configuring against an enterprise server please omit the enterprise stanza bellow
    enterprise:
        base_url: "http(s)://[your-ghe-hostname]/api/v3/"
        upload_url: "http(s)://[your-ghe-hostname]/api/uploads/"
```

You must specify either `orgs` or `repos` in the configuration. If a repository is specified in both `orgs` and `repos`, it will be extracted only once, and other repositories from that organization will be ignored.

It is recommended that you use environment variable expansion for the access token in production. For example, if the access token is stored in an environment variable called `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`:

```yaml copy
spec:
  access_token: ${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```
