The CloudQuery Snyk plugin pulls configuration out of Snyk resources and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

## Authentication

In order to fetch information from Snyk, `cloudquery` needs to be authenticated.
An API key is required for authentication.
See [Authentication for API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api-info/authentication-for-api) for more information.
