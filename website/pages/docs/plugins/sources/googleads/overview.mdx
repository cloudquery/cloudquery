<Badge text={"Latest: " + getLatestVersion("source", `googleads`)}/>

This is a premium plugin that you can buy [here](https://cloudquery.io/buy/googleads) (`$50` with 6 months of free updates and support).

The CloudQuery Google Ads plugin for CloudQuery pulls configuration from
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/)
and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).
