# Google Ads Source Plugin

import { Badge } from "../../../../../components/Badge";

This is a premium plugin that you can buy [here](/integrations/googleads).

The CloudQuery Google Ads plugin for CloudQuery pulls configuration from
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/)
and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).
