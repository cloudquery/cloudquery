The CloudQuery HubSpot plugin extracts HubSpot information and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)). It is based on the [HubSpot API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) and the [github.com/clarkmcc/go-hubspot](https://github.com/clarkmcc/go-hubspot) library.

<Callout type="warning">

The HubSpot REST API is [rate limited](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/usage-details#rate-limits).
By default, CloudQuery makes up to 5 API requests per second - but you may need to increase/decrease this value depending on your HubSpot subscription.
You can use the `max_requests_per_second` configuration option to change this value (see below).
