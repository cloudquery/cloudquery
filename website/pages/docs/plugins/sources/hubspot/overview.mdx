The CloudQuery HubSpot plugin extracts HubSpot information into your destination. It is based on the [HubSpot API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) and the [github.com/clarkmcc/go-hubspot](https://github.com/clarkmcc/go-hubspot) library.

<Callout type="warning">

The HubSpot API is heavily [rate limited](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/usage-details#rate-limits). If you encounter 
rate limit errors when running the HubSpot plugin, please let us know by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) or by contacting us on [Discord](https://www.cloudquery.io/discord).

## Authentication

In Order for CloudQuery to sync resources from your HubSpot setup, you will need to authenticate with your HubSpot account. You will need to create a [HubSpot Private App](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps), and export the App Token in `HUBSPOT_APP_TOKEN` environment variable.

```bash
export HUBSPOT_APP_TOKEN=<your_app_token>
```

## Configuration

In order to get started with the HubSpot plugin, you need to create a YAML file in your CloudQuery configuration directory (e.g. named `hubspot.yml`).

The following example sets up the HubSpot plugin, and connects it to a postgresql destination:

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: "hubspot"
  path: cloudquery/hubspot
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_HUBSPOT" 
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
  tables: ["*"]
  spec:
```
