The AWS Pricing Source plugin for CloudQuery extracts data from the [AWS Bulk Pricing Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/using-ppslong.html) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

## Configuration

The following configuration syncs from AWS Pricing service to a Postgres destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/reference/source-spec). The config for the `postgresql` destination is not shown here. See our [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) if you need help setting up the destination.

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  name: "awspricing"
  path: "cloudquery/awspricing"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWSPRICING"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: 
    - "postgresql"
  spec:
```


## AWS Pricing Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the AWS Pricing source plugin.
- `region_codes` ([]string) (default: empty. Will sync data for all regions)

  Specify which region_codes to sync data for. No regular expressions are supported, matches must be an exact match
  Note: This is not just AWS Commercial regions. It includes Wavelength Zones and regions in other partitions (Gov Cloud and China). 

- `offer_codes` ([]string) (default: empty. Will sync data for all services)

  Specify which services to sync data for. Regular expressions are not supported: matches must be exact.
  Note: This is a unique code for the product of an AWS service. For example, `AmazonEC2`, `AmazonS3` or `comprehend`
