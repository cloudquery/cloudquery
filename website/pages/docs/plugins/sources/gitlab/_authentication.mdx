In order to fetch information from GitLab, `cloudquery` needs to be authenticated. An access token is required for authentication. Instructions on how to generate an access token [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token). Note that this token should only have read-only access to the resources you intend to use.
