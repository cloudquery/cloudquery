  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_NOTION"

  spec:

```

<Callout type="info">
This example uses [environment variable expansion](/docs/advanced-topics/environment-variable-substitution) to read the token from an `NOTION_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. You can also hardcode the value in the configuration file, but this is not advised for production settings.
