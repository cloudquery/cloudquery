# Hacker News Source Plugin

import { getLatestVersion } from "../../../../../utils/versions";
import { Badge } from "../../../../../components/Badge";

<Badge text={"Latest: " + getLatestVersion("source", `hackernews`)}/>

The Hacker News Source plugin for CloudQuery extracts configuration from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL).

It can be used for real applications, but is mainly intended to serve as an example of an incremental CloudQuery Source plugin. 

## Configuration

The following configuration syncs from Hacker News to a Postgres destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/reference/source-spec). The config for the `postgresql` destination is not shown here. See our [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) if you need help setting up the destination.

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: "hackernews"
  path: "cloudquery/hackernews"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_HACKERNEWS"
  tables: ["*"]
  backend: local
  destinations: 
    - "postgresql"
  spec:
    item_concurrency: 100
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">

Note that if `backend: local` is not specified, the default will be no backend. This will result in all items being fetched on every sync, instead of incremental syncs.

</Callout>

- `item_concurrency` (int, optional):
    The number of items to fetch concurrently. Defaults to 100.

- `start_time` (string, optional):
    A date-time string in RFC3339 format. For example, `"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"` will sync all items created on or after January 1, 2023. If not specified, the plugin will fetch all items. Note that because this is an incremental table, a previous cursor position will take precedence over this setting, unless the given start time is after the last cursor position.

## Example Queries
