# Hacker News Source Plugin

import { getLatestVersion } from "../../../../../utils/versions";
import { Badge } from "../../../../../components/Badge";
import Configuration from "./_configuration.mdx";

<Badge text={"Latest: " + getLatestVersion("source", `hackernews`)}/>

The Hacker News Source plugin for CloudQuery extracts configuration from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

It can be used for real applications, but is mainly intended to serve as an example of CloudQuery Source plugin with an incremental table.

## Configuration

The following configuration syncs from Hacker News to a Postgres destination, using a special table (`cq_hackernews_state`) to store the state of the last sync. It is also possible to any other CloudQuery destination as a state backend. For more on this, see [Managing Incremental Tables](/docs/advanced-topics/managing-incremental-tables).

The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec). The config for the `postgresql` destination is not shown here. See our [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) if you need help setting up the destination.

<Configuration/>

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">

Note that if `backend_options` is omitted, by default no backend will be used. This will result in all items being fetched on every sync.

</Callout>

- `item_concurrency` (int, optional):
    The number of items to fetch concurrently. Defaults to 100.

- `start_time` (string, optional):
    A date-time string in RFC3339 format. For example, `"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"` will sync all items created on or after January 1, 2023. If not specified, the plugin will fetch all items. Note that because this is an incremental table, a previous cursor position will take precedence over this setting, unless the given start time is after the last cursor position.

## Example Queries
