The Fastly plugin requires an API key to authenticate with Fastly. You can generate an API key in the Fastly UI by [following the instructions in the Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens).

Once you have an API key, export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export FASTLY_API_TOKEN=<your_api_key>
```

(MacOS / Linux) or

```bash
set FASTLY_API_TOKEN=<your_api_key>
```

(Windows)
