This example syncs from Fastly to a destination, using the token provided in an environment variable called `FASTLY_API_KEY`. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: source
# Common source-plugin configuration
spec:
  name: fastly
  path: cloudquery/fastly
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_FASTLY"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  # Fastly specific configuration
  spec:
    fastly_api_key: "${FASTLY_API_KEY}"
```
