This is a premium plugin that you can buy [here](https://cloudquery.io/buy/vercel) (`$50` with 6 months of free updates and support).

The CloudQuery Vercel plugin pulls configuration out of Vercel resources and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).
