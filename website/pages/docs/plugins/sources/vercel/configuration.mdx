# Vercel Source Plugin Configuration Reference

## Example

This example syncs from Vercel to a Postgres destination, using API Key authentication. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec). Incremental syncing is enabled and will be saved to a `.cq/state/` directory by default.

import Configuration from "./_configuration.mdx";

<Configuration />

## Vercel Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the Vercel source plugin:

- `access_token` (string, required):
  An access token for your Vercel account. Get yours from [Vercel's Account Tokens Page](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).

- `team_ids` (list of string, optional):
  A list of team IDs to sync. If not specified, all teams will be synced. To find the ID of a specific team, refer to [Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team#find-your-team-id).

- `endpoint_url` (string, optional. Default: `https://api.vercel.com`):
  API endpoint URL to use. For Vercel's production API, this should be `https://api.vercel.com`.

- `timeout_secs` (integer in seconds, optional. Default: 5):
  Timeout for requests against the Vercel REST API.

- `max_retries` (integer in seconds, optional. Default: 10):
  Maximum number of retries for requests against the Vercel REST API.

- `max_wait_secs` (integer in seconds, optional. Default: 300):
  Maximum wait time between rate limited API requests. The plugin waits until the rate limit resets. If there's a need to wait longer than this time, the request will fail.

- `page_size` (integer, optional. Default: 100):
  Number of items to request in each API call. This is a tradeoff between the number of API calls and the number of items per API call, which might take too long. The maximum allowed value is 100.

- `concurrency` (integer, optional. Default: 10000):
    Number of concurrent requests to Vercel REST API.
