The CloudQuery MySQL plugin syncs your MySQL database to any of the supported CloudQuery destinations (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).
Supported database versions are >= 5.7.

### Example

This example configures a MySQL source, located at `localhost:3306`. The (top level) spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).

<Configuration/>

## MySQL spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the MySQL destination plugin.

Make sure you use [environment variable expansion](/docs/advanced-topics/environment-variable-substitution) in production instead of committing the credentials to the configuration file directly.
