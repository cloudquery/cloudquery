The Homebrew Source plugin for CloudQuery extracts configuration from the [Homebrew Analytics API](https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

The Homebrew Analytics API exposes data for the top 10,000 Homebrew formula installs, aggregated over 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day periods. The plugin can fetch data for any of these periods. When synced on a regular basis, the plugin can be used to track the popularity of Homebrew formulae over time.

## Configuration

The following configuration syncs from Homebrew to a Postgres destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec). The config for the `postgresql` destination is not shown here. See our [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) if you need help setting up the destination.

<Configuration/>

## Homebrew Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the Homebrew source plugin:

- `concurrency` (int, optional, default: 50000):
  A best effort maximum number of Go routines to use. Lower this number to reduce memory usage.

## Example Queries
