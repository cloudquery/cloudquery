# Multi Account Configuration Tutorial

## AWS Organizations

The plugin supports discovery of AWS Accounts via AWS Organizations. This means that as Accounts get added or removed from your organization, it will be able to handle new or removed accounts without any configuration changes.

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws
  registry: github
  path: cloudquery/aws
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_AWS"
  tables: ['aws_s3_buckets']
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
  spec:
    aws_debug: false
    org:
      admin_account:
        local_profile: "<NAMED_PROFILE>"
      member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
    regions:
      - '*'
```

Prerequisites for using AWS Org functionality:

1. Have a role (or user) in an Admin account with the following access:

- `organizations:ListAccounts`
- `organizations:ListAccountsForParent`
- `organizations:ListChildren`

2. Have a role in each member account that has a trust policy with a single principal. The default profile name is `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`. The [`OrganizationAccountAccessRole` is created by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role) in AWS Accounts created as part of an AWS Organization. We do not recommend using the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` due to the level of permissions typically granted to the role, but instead recommend for CloudQuery users to create their own IAM roles in each member account with the appropriate read-only permissions. We also recommend ensuring that the IAM roles and policies used for CloudQuery adhere to company security standards.

- Reference IAM assets and the CloudFormation templates for deployment in an AWS Organization for CloudQuery can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/iam-for-aws-orgs).

Configuring AWS Organization:

1. It is always necessary to specify a member role name:

   ```yaml copy
       org:
         member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
   ```

2. Sourcing credentials that have the necessary `organizations` permissions can be done in any of the following ways:

   1. Source credentials from the default credential tool chain:

      ```yaml copy
          org:
            member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
      ```

   2. Source credentials from a named profile in the shared configuration or credentials file

      ```yaml copy
          org:
            member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
            admin_account:
              local_profile: <Named-Profile>
      ```

   3. Assume a role in admin account using credentials in the shared configuration or credentials file:

      ```yaml copy
          org:
            member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
            admin_account:
              local_profile: <Named-Profile>
              role_arn: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME>

              # Optional. Specify the name of the session
              # role_session_name: ""

              # Optional. Specify the ExternalID if required for trust policy
              # external_id: ""
      ```

3. Optional. If the trust policy configured for the member accounts requires different credentials than you configured in the previous step, then you can specify the credentials to use in the `member_trusted_principal` block:

   ```yaml copy
       org:
         member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
         member_trusted_principal:
           local_profile: <Named-Profile-Member>
   ```

4. Optional. If you want to specify specific Organizational Units to fetch from you can add them to the `organization_units` list.

   ```yaml copy
       org:
         member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
         organization_units:
           - ou-<ID-1>
           - ou-<ID-2>
   ```

   Child OUs will also be included. To skip a child OU or account, use the `skip_organization_units` or `skip_member_accounts` options respectively:

   ```yaml copy
       org:
         member_role_name: cloudquery-ro
         organization_units:
           - ou-<ID-1>
           - ou-<ID-2>
         skip_organization_units:
           - ou-<ID-3>
         skip_member_accounts:
           - <ACCOUNT_ID>
   ```

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info">
Note that in AWS plugin versions before v9.0.0, child OUs were not traversed when specifying an OU, and `skip_organization_units` and `skip_member_accounts` were not supported. These options are only available in v9.0.0 and above, and child OUs are now traversed by default.
</Callout>

### Arguments for Org block

See [AWS org configuration](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/configuration#org) for more information on all the arguments in the `org` block.

## Multi Account: Specific Accounts

CloudQuery can fetch from multiple accounts in parallel by using AssumeRole (You will need to use credentials that can AssumeRole to all other specified accounts). Below is an example configuration:

```yaml copy
accounts:
  - id: <AccountID_Alias_1>
    role_arn: <YOUR_ROLE_ARN_1>
    # Optional. Local Profile is the named profile in your shared configuration file (usually `~/.aws/config`) that you want to use for this specific account
    local_profile: <NAMED_PROFILE>
    # Optional. Specify the Role Session name
    role_session_name: ""
  - id: <AccountID_Alias_2>
    local_profile: provider
    # Optional. Role ARN we want to assume when accessing this account
    role_arn: <YOUR_ROLE_ARN_2>
```

### Arguments for Accounts block

See [AWS accounts configuration](/docs/plugins/sources/aws/configuration#account) for more information on all the arguments in the `accounts` block.
