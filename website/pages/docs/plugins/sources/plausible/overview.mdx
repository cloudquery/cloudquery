The CloudQuery Plausible plugin extracts information from your [Plausible Analytics Stats API](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#get-apiv1statstimeseries) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, â€¦).

## Setup

First you must have a [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/sites) account and an API key. You can find your API key in the [Plausible Analytics Settings](https://plausible.io/sites).

## Configuration

This example syncs analytics from plausible API to a specified CQ destination. Running the following job on a daily basis will keep your db up to date with the latest events and without duplicates (as long as you use `overwrite` write mode).

```yaml copy
kind: source
# Common source-plugin configuration
spec:
  name: plausible
  path: cloudquery/plausible
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_PLAUSIBLE"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["destination"]
  # Plugin specific configuration
  spec:
    site_id: "YOUR_SITE_ID" # required
    api_key: ${API_KEY} # requried
    period: "30d" # optional
```

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you use environment variable expansion in production instead of committing the credentials to the configuration file directly.
</Callout>

## Plausible Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by this plugin:

- `site_id` (string, required):
   
  This is the value of your domain where plausible is deployed. If you're unsure, navigate to your site settings in Plausible and grab the value of the domain field.

- `api_key` (string, required):

  This is your secret API key which you can obtain for your account by going to your user settings page [plausible.io/settings](https://plausible.io/settings).

- `period` (string, optional, default: `30d`):

  [Time period](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#time-periods) to fetch data.

- `Filters` (string, optional, default: `null`):
  
  Filter results, see [Plausible Analytics Filters](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#filtering).

- `metrics` (string array, optional, default: `["visitors", "pageviews", "bounce_rate", "visit_duration", "visits"]`):

  By default the plugin will sync all metrics.

- `interval` (string array, optional, `date`):
    
  Choose your reporting interval. Valid options are `date` (always) and month (when specified period is longer than one calendar month).

- `base_url` (string, optional, `https://plausible.io`):
    
  Base URL for the Plausible API. If you are using self-hosted version this should be changed to the domain where plausible is hosted.

## Example Queries

### Sum all visitors since date

```sql copy
select sum(visitors) from plausible_stats_timeseries where date >= '2021-01-01';
```

### Select all dates where bounce rate was above 50%

```sql copy
select date, bounce_rate from plausible_stats_timeseries where bounce_rate > 50;
```
