This is a premium plugin that you can buy [here](/integrations/plausible).

The CloudQuery Plausible plugin extracts information from your [Plausible Analytics Stats API](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#get-apiv1statstimeseries) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

## Authentication

<Authentication/>

## Configuration

This example syncs analytics from plausible API to a specified CQ destination. Running the following job on a daily basis will keep your db up to date with the latest events and without duplicates (as long as you use `overwrite` write mode).

<Configuration/>

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you use environment variable expansion in production instead of committing the credentials to the configuration file directly.
</Callout>

## Plausible Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by this plugin:

- `site_id` (string, required):
   
  This is the value of your domain where plausible is deployed. If you're unsure, navigate to your site settings in Plausible and grab the value of the domain field.

- `api_key` (string, required):

  This is your secret API key which you can obtain for your account by going to your user settings page [plausible.io/settings](https://plausible.io/settings).

- `period` (string, optional, default: `30d`):

  [Time period](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#time-periods) to fetch data.

- `Filters` (string, optional, default: `null`):
  
  Filter results, see [Plausible Analytics Filters](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#filtering).

- `metrics` (string array, optional, default: `["visitors", "pageviews", "bounce_rate", "visit_duration", "visits"]`):

  By default the plugin will sync all metrics.

- `interval` (string array, optional, `date`):
    
  Choose your reporting interval. Valid options are `date` (always) and month (when specified period is longer than one calendar month).

- `base_url` (string, optional, `https://plausible.io`):
    
  Base URL for the Plausible API. If you are using self-hosted version this should be changed to the domain where plausible is hosted.
