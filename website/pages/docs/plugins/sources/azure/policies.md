# Policies and Compliance Frameworks

Policies are a set of standard SQL queries that can be run to check the security and compliance of your cloud resources against best practice frameworks.

This page documents the available CloudQuery SQL Policies for Azure. See the [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/azure/policies) for installation instructions.
