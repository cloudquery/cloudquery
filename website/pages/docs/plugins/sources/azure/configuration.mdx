# CloudQuery Azure Source Plugin Configuration Reference

## Example

This example connects a single Azure subscription to a single destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).

import Configuration from './_configuration.mdx';

<Configuration/>

## Azure Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by the Azure source plugin.

- `subscriptions` ([]string) (default: empty. Will use all visible subscriptions)

  Specify which subscriptions to sync data from.

- `cloud_name` (string) (default: empty)

  The name of the cloud environment to use. Possible values are `AzureCloud`, `AzureChinaCloud`, `AzureUSGovernment`.
  See the [Azure CLI documentation for more information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-clouds-azure-cli).

- `discovery_concurrency` (int) (default: 400)

  During initialization the Azure source plugin discovers all resource groups and enabled resource providers per subscription, to be used later on during the sync process.
  The plugin runs the discovery process in parallel. This setting controls the maximum number of concurrent requests to the Azure API during discovery.
  Only accounts with many subscriptions should require modifying this setting, to either lower it to avoid network errors, or to increase it to speed up the discovery process.
