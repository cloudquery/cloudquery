In order to fetch information from Cloudflare, `cloudquery` needs to be authenticated. There are a few options for authentication:

- Export the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` environment variable
- Export the `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` environment variables
- Specify either the `api_token` or `api_email, api_key` parameters in the YAML configuration (See [Configuration](/docs/plugins/sources/cloudflare/configuration) for more details).

The plugin requires only _read_ permissions.  To start, Cloudflare has a `read all resources` [API token template](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/template/) that will grant CloudQuery the necessary permissions to fetch information from Cloudflare.  As necessary, those permissions can be refined and modified further to meet your needs.
