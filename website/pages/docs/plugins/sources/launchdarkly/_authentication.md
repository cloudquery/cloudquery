In order to fetch information from LaunchDarkly, `cloudquery` needs to be authenticated using an Access Token from your LaunchDarkly account. You can view and manage your access tokens in LaunchDarkly `Account settings > Authorization`. Refer to [REST API Authentication](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Overview/Authentication) for more information.

### Access Token API Version
