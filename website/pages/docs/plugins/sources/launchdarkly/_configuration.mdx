The LaunchDarkly plugin supports incremental syncing for audit log data. This means that only new audit log entries will be fetched from LaunchDarkly and loaded into your destination. This is done by keeping track of the entry fetched and only fetching entries that has been created since then.
To enable this, `backend` option must be set in the spec (as shown in the example). This is documented in the [Managing Incremental Tables](/docs/advanced-topics/managing-incremental-tables) section.
