    backends:
      - name: local
        type: local
        config:
          path: /tmp/cloudquery
      - name: s3
        type: s3
        config:
          bucket: <bucket>
          key: <key>
          region: <region>
          role_arn: <role_arn>
```

You can have multiple backends at the same time, by describing them in the configuration. Every configuration block describes one backend to handle.
CloudQuery currently supports `local` and `s3` backends.
