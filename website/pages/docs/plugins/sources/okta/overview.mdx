The CloudQuery Okta plugin extracts Okta resources.

## Authentication

To [authenticate](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/overview/) CloudQuery with your Okta account you need to set an `OKTA_API_TOKEN` environment variable or add it the configuration.

## Configuration

In order to get started with the Okta plugin, you need to create a YAML file in your CloudQuery configuration directory (e.g. named `okta.yml`).

The following example sets up the Okta plugin, and connects it to a postgresql destination:

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: okta
  path: cloudquery/okta
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_OKTA"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]
  spec:
    # Required. Your Okta domain name
    domain: "https://<YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN>.okta.com/"

    # Optional. Okta Token to access API, you can set this with OKTA_API_TOKEN environment variable
    # ⚠️ Warning - Your token should be kept secret and not committed to source control
    # token: "<YOUR_OKTA_TOKEN>"
```

- `domain` (Required) - Specify the Okta domain you are fetching from. [Visit this link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/find-your-domain/findorg/) to find your Okta domain
- `token` (Optional) - Okta Token to access the API. You can set this with an `OKTA_API_TOKEN` environment variable

## Example Queries

### List all users in Okta

```sql copy
select 
  id,
  profile->>'firstName' as first_name,
  profile->>'lastName' as last_name,
  profile->>'email' as email,
  status
from okta_users;
```

### List all active users

```sql copy
select
  id,
  profile->>'firstName' as first_name,
  profile->>'lastName' as last_name,
  profile->>'email' as email,
  status from okta_users
where
  status = 'ACTIVE';
```

### List active Okta applications

```sql copy
select
  id,
  name
from
  okta_applications
where status = 'ACTIVE';
```

### List active Okta applications, ordered by number of users

```sql copy
select 
  a.id,
  a.name,
  a.status,
  count(u) 
from okta_applications a 
  left join okta_application_users u 
    on u.app_id = a.id 
group by a.id, a.name
order by count desc;
```
