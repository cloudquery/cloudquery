The CloudQuery Square plugin pulls data from [Square](https://www.squareup.com/) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

See [tables](/docs/plugins/sources/square/tables) for a list of resources supported.

## Example Configuration
