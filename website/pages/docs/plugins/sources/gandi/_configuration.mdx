```yaml copy
kind: source
# Common source-plugin configuration
spec:
  name: gandi
  path: /path/to/downloaded/plugin # https://cloudquery.io/buy/gandi
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_GANDI"
  concurrency: 10000
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["DESTINATION_NAME"]

  # Gandi specific configuration
  spec:
    api_key: "${GANDI_API_KEY}"
```

This example syncs from Gandi to the DESTINATION_NAME destination, using `api_key` authentication. It reads the value of the API key from an environment variable called `GANDI_API_KEY`. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).
