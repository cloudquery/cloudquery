In order to fetch information from Gandi, `cloudquery` needs to be authenticated. An API key is required for authentication. Get your API key from [Gandi's Account Settings Page](https://account.gandi.net/en/).

Once you have your API key, you can store it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GANDI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

(MacOS / Linux) or

```bash
set GANDI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

(Windows)
