The CloudQuery Firestore plugin reads information from your Firestore database and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

## Authentication

<Authentication />

## Configuration

<Configuration />

For more information on downloading, installing and running the CloudQuery CLI, see the [Quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart).

# Firestore Source Plugin Configuration Reference

## Example

This example connects a single Firestore project to a PostgreSQL destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: "firestore"
  path: "cloudquery/firestore"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_FIRESTORE"
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  spec:
    # Firestore Spec section described below
    project_id: "my-project"
```

## Firestore Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by Firestore Source Plugin

- `project_id` ([]string) (default: auto detect. Will detect the project id from the credentials)

  Specify project id to use when syncing Firestore resources. If not specified, the project id will be auto detected from the credentials. See more about auto detection [here](https://cloud.google.com/go/docs/reference/cloud.google.com/go/firestore/latest#cloud_google_com_go_firestore_DetectProjectID)

- `service_account_json` (string) (default: empty).

  Firestore service account JSON content. Using service accounts is not recommended, but if it is used it is better to use [environment or file variable substitution](/docs/advanced-topics/environment-variable-substitution).

- `use_base64` (bool) (default: false).
  If true, the service account JSON content will treated as base64 encoded, and will be decoded before being used.
