The CloudQuery Oracle plugin extracts Oracle Cloud Infrastructure data (`oci`) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)). It is based on [the OCI Go SDK](https://github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk) and the [Oracle Cloud REST API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/).

## Authentication

<Authentication/>

## Configuration

In order to get started with the Oracle plugin, you need to create a YAML file in your CloudQuery configuration directory (e.g. named `oracle.yml`).

The following example sets up the Oracle plugin, and connects it to a postgresql destination:

<Configuration/>

See [tables](/docs/plugins/sources/oracle/tables) for a full list of available tables.

## Oracle Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by Oracle Source Plugin

- `concurrency` (int, optional, default: 10000):
  A best effort maximum number of Go routines to use. Lower this number to reduce memory usage.
