[Google Analytics Data API v1](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1)
authentication is based on [OAuth 2.0 authorization](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).
The following methods are supported:

- OAuth 2.0

  The following options are available when using OAuth:

  - Using already available access token
    This token should be authorized for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly` scope
    (e.g., by using [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)).

  - Using OAuth client ID & client secret
    You can get your own OAuth credentials using
    [this guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#1.-obtain-oauth-2.0-credentials-from-the-dynamic_data.setvar.console_name-.).

- [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default).
  **Note**: You will still need to authorize these credentials for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly` scope.

  Available options are all the same options described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) in detail:

  - Local Environment:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly \
    --client-id-file=[PATH/TO/credentials.json]
    ```
  See [this guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/quickstart-cli) for local environment to get you started.

  - Google Cloud cloud-based development environment:

    - When you run on Cloud Shell or Cloud Code credentials are already available.

  - Google Cloud containerized environment:

    - When running on GKE use [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity).

  - [Google Cloud services that support attaching a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#attached-sa):

    - Services such as Compute Engine, App Engine and functions supporting attaching a user-managed service account which will CloudQuery will be able to utilize.

  - On-premises or another cloud provider

    - The suggested way is to use [Workload identity federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation)
    - If not available you can always use service account keys and export the location of the key via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
      **Highly not recommended as long-lived keys are a security risk**.
