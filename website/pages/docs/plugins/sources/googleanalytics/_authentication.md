[Google Analytics Data API v1](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1)
authentication is based on [OAuth 2.0 authorization](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

Two methods are supported: OAuth 2.0 and Application Default Credentials.

### OAuth 2.0

The following options are available when using OAuth:

- **Using an existing access token**

  This token should be authorized for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly` scope (e.g. by using [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)).

- **Using OAuth client ID & client secret**

  You can get your own OAuth credentials using [this guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#1.-obtain-oauth-2.0-credentials-from-the-dynamic_data.setvar.console_name-.).

### Application Default Credentials

See the official [Application Default Credentials guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default).

**Note**: You will still need to authorize these credentials for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly` scope.

Available options are all the same options described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) in detail.

#### Local Environment

See [this guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/quickstart-cli) for local environment to get you started.

The final step is to run:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly \
  --client-id-file=[PATH/TO/credentials.json]
```

#### Google Cloud cloud-based development environment

When you run on Cloud Shell or Cloud Code credentials are already available.

#### Google Cloud containerized environment

When running on GKE use [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity).

#### Google Cloud services that support attaching a service account

Services such as Compute Engine, App Engine and functions supporting attaching a user-managed service account which will CloudQuery will be able to utilize.
You can find out more [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#attached-sa).

#### On-premises or another cloud provider

The suggested way is to use [Workload identity federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).
If not available, you can use service account keys and export the location of the key via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
**This is not recommended as long-lived keys present a security risk**.
