## Query Examples

### Find public facing spaces

```sql copy
--  public facing spaces are accessible by anyone, easily query which space is public facing in your account
SELECT bucket->>'Name',location,public FROM digitalocean_spaces WHERE public = true;
```

### List Droplets with public facing ipv4 or ipv6

```sql copy
-- Find any droplets that have a public ipv6 or ipv4 IP
SELECT id, name, v4->>'ip_address' AS address_v4, v4->>'netmask' AS netmask_v4, v4->>'gateway' AS gateway_v4,
       v6->>'ip_address' AS address_v6, v6->>'netmask' AS netmask_v6, v6->>'gateway' AS gateway_v6
FROM 
  (SELECT id,name,v4,NULL as v6 FROM digitalocean_droplets CROSS JOIN JSONB_ARRAY_ELEMENTS(digitalocean_droplets.networks->'v4') AS v4 
  UNION
  SELECT id,name,NULL as v4,v6 FROM digitalocean_droplets CROSS JOIN JSONB_ARRAY_ELEMENTS(digitalocean_droplets.networks->'v6') AS v6) AS union_v46
WHERE v4->>'type' = 'public' OR v6->>'type' = 'public';
```
