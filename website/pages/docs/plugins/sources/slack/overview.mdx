# Slack Source Plugin

import { Badge } from "../../../../../components/Badge";
import Authentication from "./_authentication.mdx";

<Badge text={"Premium"}/>

This is a premium plugin that you can buy [here](/integrations/slack).

The CloudQuery Slack plugin extracts information from your Slack organization(s) and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)).

## Installation

<Authentication/>

## Syncing message histories

The Slack source plugin supports syncing of message histories, but **only for channels that the bot is added to**. If you would like to sync the messages and threads in a channel, add the CloudQuery bot that you installed in Step 1 to the channel before running a sync, and make sure that the `slack_conversation_histories` table is included in the tables list in your Slack plugin source config.

## Example Queries

### List all active users in the Slack workspace

```sql copy
select id, name from slack_users where deleted is not true;
```

### Rank users by number of messages sent in public channels

```sql copy
select 
    u.name, count(h.user) 
from slack_conversation_histories h 
    join slack_conversation_replies r on h.ts = r.conversation_history_ts 
    join slack_users u on u.id = h.user 
group by u.name order by count desc;
```

### List all bookmarks

```sql copy
select title, link from slack_conversation_bookmarks;
```


### List URLs to all uploaded files

```sql copy
select title, url_private from slack_files;

### List all external files
