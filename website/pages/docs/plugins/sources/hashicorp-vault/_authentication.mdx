The plugin needs to be authenticated in order to sync information from your Vault server.

The plugin requires only _read_ permissions (we will never make any changes to your vault server), so, following the principle of least privilege, it's recommended to grant it read-only permissions.

In order for CloudQuery to sync resources from your Vault server,
you will need to obtain a [Vault Token](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/tokens) and configure the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.
