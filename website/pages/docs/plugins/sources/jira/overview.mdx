This is a premium plugin that you can buy [here](https://cloudquery.io/buy/jira) (`$50` with 6 months of free updates and support).

The CloudQuery Jira plugin extracts Jira information and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)). It is based on the [Jira API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/) and the [`github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira`](https://github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira) library.
