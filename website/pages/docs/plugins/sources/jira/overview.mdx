This is an open-core plugin with set of free tables available and full version that you can buy [here](/integrations/jira).

The CloudQuery Jira plugin extracts Jira information and loads it into any supported CloudQuery destination (e.g. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and [more](/docs/plugins/destinations/overview)). It is based on the [Jira API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/) and the [`github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira`](https://github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira) library.
