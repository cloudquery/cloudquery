In order for CloudQuery to sync data from Facebook Marketing, you will need a Facebook Marketing access token.
You will need to follow the following steps (if you don't have them set up already):

1. Create a business app in the [Meta App dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). [See Facebook's documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/).
  Make sure to choose the "Business" application type, and to link it to your business account.

- Add the "Marketing API" capability to your application. You should now see a dropdown "Marketing API" menu.
  In this dropdown, under `Tools`, you will be able to generate your access token. [See also Facebook's documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/overview/authentication/)

- You will also need to find your `ad_account_id`, which you can find in the [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/accounts/). 
  ([See documentation](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1492627900875762)).

CloudQuery only ever makes `READ` calls to the API, but due to the way the Facebook permission model works,
some of the tables also require `ads_management` permissions.
