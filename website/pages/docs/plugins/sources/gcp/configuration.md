# GCP Source Plugin Configuration Reference

## Example

This example connects a single GCP project to a Postgres destination. The (top level) source spec section is described in the [Source Spec Reference](/docs/reference/source-spec).

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  # Source spec section
  name: "gcp"
  path: "cloudquery/gcp"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_GCP"
  tables: ["gcp_storage_buckets"]
  destinations: ["postgresql"]

  spec:
    # GCP Spec section described below
    project_ids: ["my-project"]
```

## GCP Spec

This is the (nested) spec used by GCP Source Plugin

- `project_ids` ([]string) (default: empty. will use all projects available to the current authenticated account)

  Specify projects to connect to. If either `folder_ids` or `project_filter` is specified, these projects will be synced in addition
  to the projects from the folder/filter.

- `service_account_key_json` (string) (default: empty).

  GCP service account key content. Using service accounts is not recommended, but if it is used it is better to use [environment or file variable substitution](/docs/advanced-topics/environment-variable-substitution).

- `folder_ids` ([]string) (default: empty).
  
  cloudquery will `sync` from all the projects in the specified folders, recursively. `folder_ids` must be of the format
  `folders/<folder_id>` or `organizations/<organization_id>`. This feature requires the `resourcemanager.folders.list` permission. 
  By default cloudquery will also `sync` from subfolders recursively (up to depth 100) - to reduce this, set `folder_recursion_depth` to a lower value (or 0 to disable recursion completely).
  Mutually exclusive with `project_filter`.

- `folder_recursion_depth` (int) (default: 100).
  
  the maximum depth to recurse into subfolders. 0 means no recursion (only the top-level projects in folders will be used for `sync`).

- `project_filter` (string) (default: empty).

  A filter to determine the projects that are synced, mutually exclusive with `folder_ids`. For instance, to only sync projects where the name starts with `how-`,
  set `project_filter` to `name:how-*`. 
  
  More examples:
    - `"name:how-* OR name:test-*"` matches projects starting with `how-` or `test-`
    - `"NOT name:test-*"` matches all projects *not* starting with `test-`

- `organization_ids` ([]string) (default: empty. will use all organizations available to the current authenticated account)

  Specify organizations to use when syncing organization level resources (e.g. [folders](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/0e384a84d1c9545b24c2eda9af00f111bab79c36/plugins/source/gcp/resources/services/resourcemanager/folders_fetch.go#L23) or [security findings](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/0e384a84d1c9545b24c2eda9af00f111bab79c36/plugins/source/gcp/resources/services/securitycenter/organization_findings.go#L43)). If `organization_filter` is specified, these organizations will be used in addition to the organizations from the filter.

- `organization_filter` (string) (default: empty).

  A filter to determine the organizations to use when syncing organization level resources (e.g. [folders](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/0e384a84d1c9545b24c2eda9af00f111bab79c36/plugins/source/gcp/resources/services/resourcemanager/folders_fetch.go#L23) or [security findings](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/0e384a84d1c9545b24c2eda9af00f111bab79c36/plugins/source/gcp/resources/services/securitycenter/organization_findings.go#L43)). For instance, to use only organizations from the `cloudquery.io` domain, set `organization_filter` to `domain:cloudquery.io`. For syntax and example queries refer to API Reference [here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/organizations/search#google.cloudresourcemanager.v1.SearchOrganizationsRequest).

- `backoff_delay` (int) (default: 30).
  If specified APIs will be retried with exponential backoff if they are rate limited. This is the max delay (in seconds) between retries.

- `backoff_retries` (int) (default: 0).
  If specified APIs will be retried with exponential backoff if they are rate limited. This is the max number of retries.

- `enabled_services_only` (bool) (default: false).
If enabled CloudQuery will skip any resources that belong to a service that has been disabled or not been enabled. If you use this option on a large organization (with more than 500 projects) you should also set the `backoff_retries` to a value greater than `0` otherwise the sync could fail because of rate limiting.

## GCP + Kubernetes (GKE)

```yaml copy
kind: source
spec:
  name: gcp
  path: "cloudquery/gcp"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_GCP"
  tables: ["gcp_container_clusters"]
  destinations: ["<destination>"]
---
kind: source
spec:
  name: k8s
  path: "cloudquery/k8s"
  version: "VERSION_SOURCE_K8S"
  tables: ["*"]
  destinations: ["<destination>"]
```

Kubernetes users may see the following message when running the K8s plugin on GKE Clusters:

```bash copy
WARNING: the gcp auth plugin is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.26+; use gcloud instead.
```

As part of an initiative to remove platform specific code from Kubernetes, authentication will begin to be delegated to authentication plugins, starting in version 1.26.

### What does this mean for CloudQuery users?

CloudQuery does not use any specific resources which hinder the upgrade.

### Install

The easiest way to upgrade, is to install `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` from `gcloud components` on Mac or Windows:

```bash copy
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

and apt on Deb based systems:

```bash copy
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

### Verify

Mac or Linux:

```bash copy
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin --version
```

Windows:

```bash copy
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin.exe --version
```

### Switch authentication methods

Set the flag:

```bash copy
export USE_GKE_GCLOUD_AUTH_PLUGIN=True
```

Update components:

```bash copy
gcloud components update
```

Force credential update:

```bash copy
gcloud container clusters get-credentials {$CLUSTER_NAME}
```

Now you should be able to use `kubectl` as normal, and you
should no longer see the warning in the CloudQuery output.
