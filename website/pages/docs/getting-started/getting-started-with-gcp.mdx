# Getting Started with GCP

<DownloadSection />

## Running

### Init command

After installing CloudQuery, you need to generate a `cloudquery.yml` file that will describe which cloud provider you want to use and which resources you want CloudQuery to ETL:

```bash
cloudquery init gcp

# cloudquery init gcp aws # This will generate a config containing gcp and aws providers
# cloudquery init --help # Show all possible auto generated configs and flags
```

All official and approved community providers are listed at [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io) with their respective documentation.

### Authenticate with GCP

CloudQuery needs to be authenticated with your GCP account in order to `fetch` information about your cloud setup.

<ReadonlyTip />

You need to set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable - see [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#command-line) for more details on where to get it.

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

<Tab>

```bash
SET GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```powershell
$Env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Fetch Command

Once `cloudquery.yml` is generated and you are authenticated with GCP, run the following command to fetch the resources.

```bash
cloudquery fetch
# cloudquery fetch --help # Show all possible fetch flags
```

### Exploring and Running Queries

<ExploreSection/>

Schema and tables for GCP are available in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/providers/cloudquery/gcp/latest/schema).

Here is an example query for GCP:

#### Find all buckets Without uniform bucket level access

```sql
SELECT project_id, name, self_link AS link
FROM gcp_storage_buckets
WHERE iam_configuration_uniform_bucket_level_access_enabled = FALSE;
```

### Cloudquery Policies

CloudQuery Policies allow users to write security, governance, cost, and compliance rules with SQL, and run them with `psql`.
You can read more about policies [here](https://docs.clouqduery.io/docs/policies).

## Next Steps

At [Cloudquery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/providers/cloudquery/gcp/latest), you can read more about the CloudQuery GCP provider - including exploring the SQL schema, and advanced configurations.
