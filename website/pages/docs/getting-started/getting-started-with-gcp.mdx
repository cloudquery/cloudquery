# Getting Started with GCP

<DownloadSection />

## Running

### Init command

After installing CloudQuery, you need to generate a `cloudquery.yml` file that will describe which cloud provider you want to use and which resources you want CloudQuery to ETL:

```bash
cloudquery init gcp

# cloudquery init gcp aws # This will generate a config containing gcp and aws providers
# cloudquery init --help # Show all possible auto generated configs and flags
```

All official and approved community providers are listed at [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io) with their respective documentation.

### Authenticate with GCP

CloudQuery needs to be authenticated with your GCP account in order to `fetch` information about your cloud setup.

<ReadonlyTip />

You need to set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable - see [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#command-line) for more details on where to get it.

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash
SET GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```powershell
$Env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Fetch Command

Once `cloudquery.yml` is generated and you are authenticated with GCP, run the following command to fetch the resources.

```bash
cloudquery fetch
# cloudquery fetch --help # Show all possible fetch flags
```

### Exploring and Running Queries

<ExploreSection/>

Schema and tables for GCP are available in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/providers/cloudquery/gcp/latest/schema).

Here is an example query for GCP:

#### Find all buckets Without uniform bucket level access

```sql
SELECT project_id, name, self_link AS link
FROM gcp_storage_buckets
WHERE iam_configuration_uniform_bucket_level_access_enabled = FALSE;
```

### Policy Command

CloudQuery Policies allow users to write security, governance, cost, and compliance rules,
using SQL as the query layer and HCL as the logical layer.

All official and approved community policies are listed on [Github](https://github.com/cloudquery/cq-provider-gcp/tree/main/policies).

#### Execute a policy

```bash
cloudquery policy run gcp//cis_v1.2.0
```

## Next Steps

At [Cloudquery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/providers/cloudquery/gcp/latest), you can read more about the CloudQuery GCP provider - including exploring the SQL schema, and advanced configurations.
