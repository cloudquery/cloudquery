Once CloudQuery fetched the resources, you can explore your cloud infrastructure with SQL!

<Tabs options={['Running psql locally', 'Running psql on the docker' ]}>

You can use `psql` to connect to your postgres instance (of course, you need to change the connection-string to match the
location and credentials of your database):

```bash
psql "postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

If you opted for running the PostgreSQL server in a docker as described above, you can also run `psql` directly from the docker
instead of installing it on your machine:

```bash
docker exec -it cloudquery_postgres psql -U postgres
```

</Tab>
