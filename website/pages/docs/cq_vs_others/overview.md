# Overview

CloudQuery is an open-source cloud asset inventory powered by SQL. A lot of the public cloud provider vendors also offer some form of cloud asset inventory and thus have some overlap.

We created comparison pages to help you understand the differences and the use-cases. Having said that, depending and the use-case, those solutions can be used together with CQ.

**Comparisons:**
