# What is CIEM?

As more and more businesses move their operations to the cloud, the need for robust security measures has become increasingly apparent. One of the most critical aspects of cloud security is managing access to cloud resources. That's where **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management** (CIEM) comes in.

CIEM is a set of tools and processes designed to help businesses manage access to their cloud resources. This includes managing user identities, permissions, and entitlements. The goal of CIEM is to ensure that only authorized users have access to cloud resources and that they have the appropriate level of access to perform their jobs.

CIEM solutions typically include several key components, such as:

1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) - IAM is a critical component of CIEM, as it allows businesses to manage user identities and permissions across different cloud environments.
2. Entitlement Management - This component allows businesses to manage access to specific resources, such as data or applications, based on the user's role or job function.
3. Compliance Monitoring - CIEM solutions also typically include compliance monitoring tools that help businesses ensure that they are meeting regulatory requirements and industry standards.

In [What is the Modern Data Stack](/docs/glossary/what-is-infrastructure-data-lake) we covered what an infrastructure data lake is and how to build one with CloudQuery. By having an infrastructure data lake you can build your own customizable CIEM with standard SQL queries and views that you can monitor and visualize with your go-to BI tools, avoiding yet-another-dashboard fatigue and the need to learn new proprietary query languages.
