# Welcome to CloudQuery

<Features page="docs" detailed={false} />

CloudQuery is the [open-source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) data integration platform for security and infrastructure teams.

CloudQuery extracts, transforms configuration from cloud APIs and stores them to any supported destination such as database,datalake,streaming for further analysis.

CloudQuery focusses on getting your configuration from cloud APIs in efficient and quality manner to your destination so you can have
raw access to your data and apply the best practices in data engineering (without us being in the middle) to solve things like Asset inventory, CSPMs, Security & Compliance, Cost, etc...

## Why CloudQuery

- **Open source**: Easily extensible plugin architecture. Contribute to our official plugins or develop your own with CloudQuery SDK.
- **Blazing fast**: CloudQuery concurrency system utilizes the excelent Go concurrency model with light-weight goroutines.
- **Database agnostic**: CloudQuery can store your configuration in any supported destination such as database,datalake,streaming for further analysis.
- **Bre-built queries**: CloudQuery maintains rich set of SQL queries and Grafana dashboards for asset inventory, CSPMs, Security & Compliance, Cost, use-cases.
- **Raw access to data**: Decouple data ingestion and having raw access to your data you can built your own security stack and re-use
  best-of-breed tools for querying (SQL,...), transformation (dbt,...) and visualization (Grafana,Preset,Metabase,PowerBI,...).
