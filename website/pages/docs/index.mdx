# Welcome to CloudQuery

<Features page="docs" detailed={false} />

CloudQuery is a versatile [open-source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) data movement tool built for developers that allows you to sync data from any [source](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source) to any [destination](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/destination).

### **Installation**

Check out the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart) for step-by-step instructions on completing your first sync with CloudQuery.

## **Why CloudQuery?**

- **High-performance data ingestion and processing:** Using Go's concurrency model and Apache Arrow, CloudQuery can quickly stream large amounts of data using [GRPC](/docs/developers/architecture).
- **Sync your data to any data destination:** You can move your data to any data source
- **Deploy anywhere:** CloudQuery can be run as a single-binary executable and deployed and run anywhere. This means you can run it in your [CI/CD pipelines](/docs/deployment/github-actions), inside your application, locally, or in the cloud.
- **Unlimited scale:** CloudQuery integrations are completely stateless and can be scaled horizontally on any platform, such as [VMs](/docs/deployment/google-cloud-vm), [Kubernetes](/docs/deployment/kubernetes), or batch jobs.
- **Security and compliance:** Reliable security measures protect sensitive data, and compliance features help meet industry standards.
- **Blazing fast**: CloudQuery is optimized for performance, utilizing the excellent Go concurrency model with lightweight Go routines and [streaming your data over GRPC](/docs/developers/architecture).
- **Open source framework**: Develop integrations in [Go](/docs/developers/creating-new-integration/go-source), [Python](/docs/developers/creating-new-integration/python-source), [Java](/docs/developers/creating-new-integration/java-source), or [JavaScript](/docs/developers/creating-new-integration/javascript-source) using the [open source CloudQuery SDK](https://github.com/cloudquery).

## **Use Cases**

- [**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/how-to-build-a-cspm-with-grafana-and-cloudquery): Use as a [CSPM](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/how-to-build-a-cspm-with-grafana-and-cloudquery) solution to monitor and enforce security policies across your cloud infrastructure for [AWS](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/aws/latest/docs), [GCP](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/gcp/latest/docs), [Azure](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/azure/latest/docs) and many more.
