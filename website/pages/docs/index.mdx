# Welcome to CloudQuery

<Features page="docs" detailed={false} />

CloudQuery is an [open-source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery),
high-performance data integration platform for security and infrastructure teams.

CloudQuery extracts, transforms, and loads configuration from cloud APIs to
variety of supported destinations such as databases, data lakes, or streaming platforms
for further analysis.

## Why CloudQuery?

- **Open source**: Easily extensible plugin architecture. Contribute to our official plugins or develop your own with the CloudQuery SDK.
- **Blazing fast**: CloudQuery's concurrency system leverages the excellent Go concurrency model with light-weight goroutines.
- **Database agnostic**: CloudQuery can store your configuration in any supported destination such as a database, data lake, or streaming platform for further analysis.
- **Pre-built queries**: CloudQuery maintains a rich set of SQL queries and Grafana dashboards for asset inventory, CSPMs, Security & Compliance, and Cost use-cases.
- **Raw access to data**: Decouple data ingestion and have raw access to your data, with which you can build your own security stack and re-use
  best-of-breed tools for querying (SQL,...), transformation (dbt,...), and visualization (Grafana, Preset, Metabase, PowerBI, ...).
