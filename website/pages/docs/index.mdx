# Welcome to CloudQuery

<Features page="docs" detailed={false} />

CloudQuery is an [open-source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery),
high-performance data integration framework built for developers, with support for a wide range of plugins.

CloudQuery extracts, transforms, and loads configuration from cloud APIs to a
variety of supported destinations such as databases, data lakes, or streaming platforms
for further analysis.

## Why CloudQuery?

- **Blazing fast**: CloudQuery is optimized for performance, utilizing the excellent Go concurrency model with light-weight goroutines.
- **Deploy anywhere**: CloudQuery plugins are single-binary executables and can be deployed and run anywhere.
- **Open source**: Extensible plugin architecture: develop your own plugins in Go, Python, Java or JavaScript using the CloudQuery SDK.
- **Pre-built queries**: CloudQuery maintains a number of out-of-the-box security and compliance policies for cloud infrastructure.
- **Unlimited scale**: CloudQuery plugins are stateless and can be scaled horizontally on any platform, such as VMs, Kubernetes or batch jobs.
