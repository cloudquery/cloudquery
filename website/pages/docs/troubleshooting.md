# Troubleshooting

## Help Channels

### Discord

First things first - feel free to join our [Discord](https://www.cloudquery.io/discord)!

### GitHub Issues

There are a couple of ways to get help for any CloudQuery-related issues or questions.

1. Check out previous issues at [https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) and open a new one if no previous one has been opened or resolved.
2. Reach out on the #help-and-support channel on [Discord](https://www.cloudquery.io/discord)

## Debugging

### Verbose Logging

Usually the first step that will be needed to debug/resolve an issue is to run `cloudquery` with `--log-level debug` to enable verbose logging.
