# Troubleshooting

## Help Channels

### Discord

First things first - feel free to join our new [Discord](https://discord.gg/2mPfFYyAtQ)!

### GitHub Issues

There are couple of ways to get help for any CloudQuery-related issues or questions.

1. Check out previous issues at [https://github.com/cloudquery](https://github.com/cloudquery) and open a new one if no previous one has been opened or resolved.

### Intercom Chat

Our Intercom chat is available on all our public sites, so feel free to drop us a line there.

## Debugging

### Verbose Logging

Usually the first step that will be needed to debug/resolve an issue is to run `cloudquery` with `-v` to enable verbose logging.
