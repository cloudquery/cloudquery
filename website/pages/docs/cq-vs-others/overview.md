# Overview

CloudQuery is an [open source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) high-performance data integration platform for developers, data teams, security teams and infrastructure teams.

CloudQuery extracts and transforms configuration from cloud APIs and stores them to any supported destination such as database, data lake, or streaming platforms for further analysis.

A lot of the public cloud providers and security vendors also offer some form of cloud asset inventory and thus have some overlap. There are also other ELT/ETL tools that can extract data from cloud APIs. 

We created this comparison section to help you understand the differences and the use-cases. Depending on the use-case, those solutions can be used together with CQ.
