# Overview

CloudQuery is an [open-source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) data integration platform for security and infrastructure teams.

CloudQuery extracts and transforms configuration from cloud APIs and stores them to any supported destination such as database, data lake, or streaming platforms for further analysis.

A lot of the public cloud providers and security vendors also offer some form of cloud asset inventory and thus have some overlap.

We created comparison pages to help you understand the differences and the use-cases. Having said that, depending and the use-case, those solutions can be used together with CQ.
