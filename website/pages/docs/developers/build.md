# Build From Source

The preferred way to use CloudQuery is through the available distribution, see the Quickstart section on the [Docs](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs)

If you want to build it from the source, follow the steps:

1. Cloudquery is developed in GO. Ensure you have a working [GO runtime](https://go.dev/)
2. Clone or download the [code repository](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery)
3. On the source code root directory execute
>./scripts/build.sh
(it will recursively run GO in all subdirectories)
