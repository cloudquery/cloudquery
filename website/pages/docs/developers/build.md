# Building From Source

The preferred way to use CloudQuery is through the available distribution, see the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) section of the [Docs](/docs)

To build CloudQuery from source, follow the steps:

1. CloudQuery is developed in Go. Ensure you have a working [Go runtime](https://go.dev/)
2. First, fork and clone the repository. If youâ€™re not sure how to do this, please watch [these videos](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
3. On the cloned repository root directory run `./scripts/build.sh` to build all CloudQuery modules (CLI, source and destination plugins)

CloudQuery binaries will be created in a new `bin` directory in the root directory
