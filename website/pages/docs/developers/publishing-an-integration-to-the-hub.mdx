# Publishing an Integration to the Hub

With the announcement of [CloudQuery Hub](/blog/announcing-cloudquery-new-hub), we are excited to see the community contribute integrations to the Hub. This guide will walk you through the process of publishing an integration to the Hub.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io/) account and completed the onboarding process to create a team
- You have the [CloudQuery CLI](/docs/quickstart) installed (version >= `v5.0.0`)
- The integration you'd like to publish is written in one of the following:
  - Go with SDK version >= `v4.17.1`
  - Python with SDK version >= `v0.1.12`
  - JavaScript with SDK version >= `v0.1.0`
- The integration you'd like to publish is initialized using the integration's name, team and kind. See example [here](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/blob/b7ef6f6ed8948272a429f35614fa28559397227a/plugins/source/test/resources/plugin/plugin.go#L15)
- You are authenticated to [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io/) using the `cloudquery login` command

## Create an Integration Definition on Hub

Before publishing an integration, you need to create an integration definition on the CloudQuery Cloud site.

Log in to [CloudQuery Cloud](https://cloud.cloudquery.io/). If you have not created a team yet, you will be asked to create a new one.

<img src="/images/docs/publishing-plugins/create-team.png" width="50%" style={{margin:"1em"}} />

The display name will be visible on Hub next to your integration. The team name is going to be used in configurations to reference your integration using `<team-name>/<high-level architecture-name>`.

To create a new integration definition, create a new integration from the Integrations tab. Fill in the necessary details and upload the integration image.

### Staging Releases

Release your integrations for internal testing first before making it public. Set the **Visibility** to `Private` and **Release Stage** to `Preview`. This enables testing of premium integrations without being charged and with your team only (you can invite other users to your team to test the integration).
When you want to release the integration in public, set the Visibility to `Public` and eventually, change the **Release Stage** to `GA` (Generally Available) to begin charging for the usage.

## Publishing an Integration

<Publish />

## Documentation Format

- The only documentation format supported at the moment is markdown, and the `cloudquery publish` command will only upload markdown files with the `.md` extension
- You can have multiple markdown files as documentation. The files will be concatenated in alphabetical order, and if one of the files is named `overview.md` it will show up first
- The markdown filename will be title cased when display in the Hub. For example `overview.md` will be displayed as `Overview`
- HTML tags are not supported in the markdown files and will be ignored
- Relative assets (e.g. `./assets/logo.png`) are not supported. We recommend using absolute URLs for assets e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/assets/logo.png` in case you have the assets on GitHub
