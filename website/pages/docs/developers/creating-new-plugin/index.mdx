# Creating a New Plugin

CloudQuery's modular architecture means that a source plugin can be used to fetch data from any third-party API, and then be combined with a destination plugin to insert data into any supported destination.

At its core, the CloudQuery protocol is language-agnostic and plugins can be written in any language, as long as the language has libraries for [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/). For ease of development, however, we recommend using our SDKs, which offer a high-level abstraction over the underlying protocol. The following table summarizes the current state of our SDKs and links to language-specific plugin development guides:
